<p>I suggest that we release a new version of the patch only if a set 
period of time has passed since the last error report (e.g. a week or 
two... not sure). From what I can see, there is still enough unresolved 
stuff on the error page, so what's the point of doing it now? - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 02:22, 30 October 2010 (CDT)

<dd>Just tested if the formatting errors have been fixed. Also, I think 
Roger just wanted to know if the new .exe is working. But I think we 
shouldn't release anything yet. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a> 03:38, 30 October 2010 (CDT)

<dd>Thing is, if you consider something in your patcher in need of 
further testing I can see how this could lead to complications since, 
like I implied, I'm not after reinventing the wheel: the installer still
 runs your patcher from within the R11 installation directory, the 
intent is just to simplify things on the user side (R11 directory 
detection, shortcut creation, uninstall function and the like).<br>In any case, you should tell me if this is inconvenient.

<dd>The reboot prompt appeared when I installed the patch over a 
not-so-clean R11 installation. So it probably was necessary to reboot. I
 applied the patch again over a clean install of R11; it didn't prompt 
for reboot. BTW, I was thrilled when the patch detected my R11 
installation located in a separate partition. lol --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a> 14:13, 10 October 2010 (CDT)

Didn't you think that for some people ~160mb will be too large? So I've 
made a small copy of patch, having removed from it movies, (with it, 
patch became just 15mb, instead of 163) and uploaded it to my server: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://oscollect.ru/outside/Remember11_EN_1.0_sfx-smallcopy.exe">download</a> I'll be glad, if you add my copy to other mirrors.

<dd>It's been discussed here recently (although it seems as if the relevant section got deleted). In a nutshell, there <i>are</i>
 plans to release a lighter version as well, but only if the majority of
 the players would complain. You're the first so far.&nbsp;:) IMO, a 
translation is something monolithic and complete; you can't just dispose
 of a part of it (no matter if it's minor or not) like that. Again, 
there's nothing wrong with having unofficial repacks, but offering these
 alongside the main patch is not unlike saying "get whichever version 
you prefer, it doesn't matter anyway" which is obviously not entirely 
true. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 06:06, 18 October 2010 (CDT)

<dd>A couple of things: Extra Voice translation.txt and TL Notes.txt 
seem to be in Shift-JIS encoding, which means some characters (e.g. 
kanji) won't show up correctly unless viewed on a machine with the 
locale set to Japanese. It's better to convert these to Unicode or 
somesuch. Also, a line in TL Notes reads "the four characters 恋?感情" - a 
character missing?

<p>What additional letters are needed in the font? I'm going to need "é"
 for "fiancé", so I might as well add italics.
Which italics are needed? Just a few, or all the capitals, or the full 
alphabet?&lt;/s&gt;
I don't know how to fix the looping music track, but I'm pretty sure I 
can fix the timestamp on Day 7 and Yuukidou. Looking into SA7_04, but 
GYAAA is probably a matter of adding a&nbsp;%N at the appropriate place.

</dd>
<dd> Okay: as for part 3, lines may not contain more than 63 characters.
 (It may be possible to add additional lines, though, which may also 
allow having romaji and translated lyrics.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 19:27, 11 September 2010 (CDT)
</dd>
<dd> Well, I put up the lyric stuff with line longer than 63 characters 
starred. Each line has two parts. First, there's a number which 
indicates when a line is supposed to be shown, probably in units of 1/60
 of a second or somesuch. I'm not sure exactly when a line is erased. 
(Is it a fixed time after being drawn? A fixed time before the next line
 is to be drawn?) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 21:27, 11 September 2010 (CDT)

<dd> Just now tried shortening stuff <i>and</i> adding romaji lines; let's see if it works? - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 00:33, 12 September 2010 (CDT)
</dd>
<dd> Looks nice, save for the glitch with the top line (it seems to 
always disappear too early). Hope it can be fixed too. By the way, 
seeing as the subtitles (?) for that ExtraVoice stuff are included there
 too, I wonder if they somehow could be shown in this way as well? 
(Because if not, then I guess it's kind of pointless to bother with 
shortening/editing them, etc) - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 08:41, 12 September 2010 (CDT)
<dl>
<dd> Well, the "glitch" with the top line disappearing early is probably
 deliberate behavior in the Japanese. (Top line is the first half of the
 lyric and the bottom line is the second half; first half disappears 
after it's been sung.) This doesn't make sense in our patch.
</dd>
<dd> Fixing may be doable, just slow and tedious digging through the 
code to find where it's doing that. (Lower priority than most anything 
else I have.)
</dd>
<dd> As for Extra Voices, if it's not displaying in game, I don't know 
how to get it to display, sorry. Also, perhaps change "Member Yuni" to 
"Private Yuni", "Seaman Yuni", or "Airman Yuni"?

 it's fine as it is. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 10:55, 12 September 2010 (CDT)

<dd>Holy shit, I somehow completely forgot to edit the Extra Voice 
files! I'll get that done today. We had Yomogi saying "Officer Yuni" in 
the main script, but I don't like that any more and feel Private would 
be more appropriate, so I'll change them all to reflect that unless 
anyone has objections/a better idea. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:The_paper" title="User:The paper">the_paper</a> 21:45, 12 September 2010 (CDT)

<dd>From what I can see in the Ending Movie script, it's just quotes 
from the game, so it doesn't really need 'translating' per say. It's 
probably best to wait until QC is done until we copy-paste the lines in,
 since the lines are still subject to change. Of course, this is 
assuming there's a video editor lurking around and that we actually WANT
 to bother translating it. This might be just me, but I thought it was 
really neat seeing those key lines in their original Japanese right at 
the end. Meh, thoughts everyone? - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 10:35, 6 August 2010 (CDT)

<dd>The idea of these quotes might seem sort of redundant, yes, but then
 again there is some sort of an author's intent behind it, so leaving it
 as it is only makes the translation less complete, that's what I think.

<dd>Just a random opinion, but it a.k.a does not mean "or", and I think 
you would lose some meaning if you replaced it with "or". If you want it
 less abbreviated you could use "also known as", but a.k.a is perfectly 
acceptable English. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/93.97.185.122" title="Special:Contributions/93.97.185.122">93.97.185.122</a> 11:28, 15 September 2010 (CDT)

<p>C'mon you guys, me and the_paper have to deal with other stuff and 
you all do next to nothing for two weeks or so? We're insanely close to 
finishing here. Are all the TIPS bugs fixed? Are all the jukebox lyrics 
OK? Because if so, just release a patch. The extras can be put in an 
update later on if they're not ready yet (they're 'extras', after all). 
So hop to it and let this 2.5 year long project come to a close. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 09:54, 27 September 2010 (CDT)

<dd>I must say there's something <b>extremely</b> unsettling/confusing 
about the ANHOLY BLASFEMOUS OVERLAP OF EVOL that some of the project 
files currently exhibit. For example, we have a whopping total of 3 
(three) separate copies for the lyrics and the Extra: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=R11:lyrics.txt" title="R11:lyrics.txt">here</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=R11:init.txt.B" title="R11:init.txt.B">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=R11:init.txt" title="R11:init.txt">here</a>
 - which makes for even more duplicated stuff (lots of it in fact) if we
 just look at init.txt and init.txt.B in general. In the first place, <i>which one of the init.txt's is actually being used in the game</i>?
 I can see one of them being stroked out and marked as old on the main 
page, but in fact, if it's not really used in the current patch then it 
should just be removed altogether since it just so happens that people 
sometimes get confused (?) and edit the older version. Again, I believe 
it was said that the main file for the lyrics is R11:lyrics.txt.<br>In 
any case, I'm mostly satisfied with the tips formatting now&nbsp;:) 
(though of course if anyone wishes to give it another run, feel free to 
do so). - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 02:43, 29 September 2010 (CDT)
</dd>
<dd> R11:init.txt is completely ignored. R11:init.txt.B is used for all 
parts of init.rp except for lyrics (0x64 lines); any 0x64 lines can be 
removed from that file. R11:lyrics.txt is the only source for lyric 
related information. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 12:10, 29 September 2010 (CDT)

First of all, I'm back and in one piece. Thanks to those who offered 
condolences and support while I was away. Sorry to hear about the 
motherboard death, Roger, but I'm glad things seem to be getting back 
underway.
An unfortunate setback, but really, I think it's time to put this thing 
to bed. Can we set a firm release deadline of October 11th? Any of the 
remaining issues are IMHO so minor that they're not worth spending more

<dd>The manual included in the RC1 patch was the one translated by me. I
 gave it to Roger when he asked for a manual translation. However, it 
was translated haphazardly (hence, the typos and translation errors), so
 the new manual that is being considered was the one translated by you 
(N.H.), only with some modified portions in the "From the translators" 
section. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a> 21:34, 5 October 2010 (CDT)

 the Japanese version, there is at least one instance when two lines

 Can you study what's different about it? Maybe they're using a 
different code to mark non-fading lines from fading ones, or perhaps 
there is a code for making a linebreak. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 11:24, 6 October 2010 (CDT)

<dd>I've said this before, but my program doesn't parse R11:exe_strings.
 I have to manually copy/paste the strings over. Which strings aren't in

 email me or give me an IM account (I'm rogerpepitone on YIM and MSN) so
 we can go through the cycle a bit faster?

9ed50, 9edb0 and probably a bunch of these error messages no-one has

release <i>today</i>; manually or not, it's better to do it anyway just 
to make sure, don't you think? Oh, and fix that dreaded Right Ctrl 
capitalization at your side already, or do you expect me to correct it

<p>Why are we using American English grammar rules for commas and 
periods, but logistic rules for question marks and exclaimation marks? I
 don't care what XY said one year ago, we're either using one style or 
the other, not a weird hybrid of the two. So everyone pick one or give a
 good reason why hybrid is OK. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 11:35, 12 August 2010 (CDT)
</p>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't "hybrid." American English puts commas and periods inside quotes ALL the time, <b>and</b> question marks (and exclamation points, ellipses, colon, semicolon, etc.) are put <b>inside if it's included in the quote</b>, <b>outside if not</b>.
 So basically, the only difference between American and British English 
in this regard is the handling of periods and commas near closing 
quotation marks.--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a> 11:25, 13 August 2010 (CDT)

<p>OK, first things first, we need to get all our info together. As far 
as I'm aware, the two remaining issues with the engine are the TIPs 
insertation and an untranslated right-click menu (which is what I meant 
by 'menu', sorry for being unclear). Are there any others? Or is that 
it? Or are those no longer issues?
</p><p>Assuming that's it, this is basically my plan:
When QC is complete, I want to release a patch, since I see no reason to
 delay it any longer. If the above hacking issues are solved by then, 
then yay. If not, then the following will occur:
</p>
<dl>
<dd> • Translations for the right click menu will be included in a .txt 
file so the player can use it as a reference should they not be able to 
read basic Japanese. (e.g. セーブ = save, etc).
</dd>
<dd> • The TIPs will be included in a subfolder also as .txt files, so 
that the player can read them that way. This *does* run the risk of 
spoilers, but warnings will be added and they'll be in the order they 
appear in game, so it'll be the player's own fault if they read 
them&nbsp;:P
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course, if either issue gets solved at a later date, then we can just release a new patch. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 20:34, 30 July 2010 (UTC)
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&gt;since I see no reason to delay it any longer<br>
</dd>
<dd>And I see no reason to suddenly go all speedsub about it. There's 
been enough partial patches already. Now I'm sure PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY 
DIE, etc if it is released seconds later, but considering the fact that 
the "alternative" is an incomplete, rushed, and, most probably (judging 
from previous QC sessions) non bug-free release, that's fine I'd 
say.&nbsp;;) - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 20:54, 30 July 2010 (UTC)<br>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for replying! I'll address your concerns one-by-one as thus:
</dd>
<dd>1. <b>&gt;And I see no reason to suddenly go all speedsub about it.</b>
 I apologise if it looks like I'm tearing through the scripts just to 
get it out onto the internet, but I'm simply as fast worker.
</dd>
<dd>2. <b>&gt;There's been enough partial patches already.</b> None of 
these, as far as I'm aware, have been of a good enough quality to 
officially release to the public. Heck, the one I played before editing 
was the exact reason why I decided to edit it.
</dd>
<dd>3. <b>&gt;...but considering the fact that the "alternative" is an 
incomplete, rushed, and, most probably (judging from previous QC 
sessions) non bug-free release...</b> That most certainly won't be the 
case. I am not rushing, as shocking as that sounds, and I trust Raide to
 catch all the bugs, errors and glitches he comes across. The above is 
simply an emergency measure should the hacking not be ready by the time 
the actual text is release-ready. If the hacking is only a few days away
 from being completed, then there's reason to wait. If we're talking 
months, no way.
</dd>
<dd>Lastly, is there something other than editing, QCing and waiting for
 news on hacking that we're all supposed to be doing? Surely the first 
two quantifies a release of some sort?
</dd>
<dd>Also, if the hacker is reading this, please reply, as I don't like guessimating. Heck, you might even be almost done! - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 08:23, 31 July 2010 (UTC)
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd>Mm-hm... Personally I can't see what is good quality about e.g. 
forcing the player to Alt+Tab back and forth to read some stuff from a 
folder. If, on the other hand, you're sure you'll manage bug-ridding 
everything that is currently accessible, then, well, proceed, it's not 
as if anyone would be raging over the matter anyway.&nbsp;:) However in 
that case, I'd like you to make sure to explicitly state that this is an
 alpha (beta, preview, whatever) release.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd>As for what else is there left to do, well I can think of this:
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><ul>
<li>Thorough TL check. From what I do gather, most of the TL guys here 
are beginners, myself included. I have seen and corrected some slightly 
mistranslated lines in the past, but that was mostly done in a 
"passer-by" mode so to say, and of course there were enough places where
 I've struggled too. So it's basically what's written on the can, 
anything that has a //check mark to it has to be TL checked (which 
includes anything that doesn't have it).
</li>
<li>Edit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=R11:init.txt" title="R11:init.txt">R11:init.txt</a>
 (as in, overally). I'm not sure if this was done before, but there 
definitely were still things left to fix last time I've checked.
</li>
<li>Try putting the translated lyrics in the jukebox, seeing if it works
 and the related pokery. If it won't work we'll probably actually have 
to sub the movies or something.
</li>
<li>Translate the ending movie. Basically, the same task as with the OP,
 the only difference being that there's a shitload of those quotes 
there. I've started to transcribe it (will put it up here eventually, 
don't have much time for this at the moment) but it will be up to 
someone else to put the matched translations there from the main text 
when we're completely finished with it.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd>p.s. Oh and just in case, I hope my posts didn't come across as 
offensive as that is not the intention at all. Your help here is 
appreciated, it's always a good thing. Rather, it's the "get it out 
there asap" attitude that confuses me a bit. The majority usually waits 
for final versions of everything anyway so I sort of don't get where the
 urge comes from. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 11:17, 31 July 2010 (UTC)<br>

<dd>Thanks, and don't worry, I'm just as worried about sounding rude ^^;
 And putting 'alpha/beta/preview' on the .txt style patch is perfectly 
fine, since there's no way we'd want it confused with the final, fully 
English patch. As for why I want it out quickly, it's more that I know a
 lot of people are frustrated over the slow progress that's happened 
since translation hit 100%. Those kinds of people are the type to play 
partials and not care about 100% hacking, thus the proposed .txt files 
idea is for them. For the players who aren't in any rush, they'd be 
happy to wait for the 'final' patch, and we can take our time in it 
without cries of 'IS IT FINISHED YET?!'. This way, both groups of 
players are happy, and everyone wins.
</dd>
<dd>Of course, if all the hacking issues are solved before QC ends, then
 the .txt file idea goes out the window and it's FULL ENGLISH PATCH ALL 
THE WAY BABY!
</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the to-do list. This is a huge help!
<ul>
<li>tl check: Finding a dedicated, experienced translator to do the 
whole game is practically impossible (as you've already noted), but the 
lines marked 'check' are perfectly doable (since there weren't too many 
from what I saw). By some crazy stroke of luck, I happen to know an 
experienced translator who's in between projects right now. I'm sure I 
can blackma- I mean, convince him to help out a little. I doubt it'd 
take long.
</li>
<li>R11:init: I'll definitely be editing that!
</li>
<li>lyrics: the files are .avi, so subbing should be no problem. Lyrics 
are kinda a low priority extra though, from my experience, and often end
 up as .txt files (LOL) in patches. It's worth experimenting with the 
Jukebox though.
</li>
<li>ending movie tl: good luck! Though please don't mysteriously disappear anytime soon ^^ (not that I think you will, but still.)
</li>
</ul>

<dd>Image patch: Replaces Japanese text in various images with English 
text. This is a slightly updated version of the patch that also modifies
 the game font to include o-umlaut and i-umlaut. init.rp: Version of 
init.bin that translates TIPS and some other in-game text. You will also
 need r11-rp.exe (modification of r11.exe that uses init.rp instead of 
init.bin, available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4no4davczbr1sgb">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4no4davczbr1sgb</a> ) if you don't have it already.)

 The new setup is working, but it still got translation misplacement, 
too-long title text that bleeds and comes with odd japanese text, and 
need a lot more extra work such as manual linebreaking each and every 
TIPS. Few bits are still untranslated such as exit menu confirmation and
 stuff <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://a.imageshack.us/img203/2118/capture28i.jpg">[20]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://a.imageshack.us/img832/9743/capture29.jpg">[21]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://a.imageshack.us/img688/2293/capture30.jpg">[22]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://a.imageshack.us/img251/6387/capture32logreturnconfi.jpg">[23]</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Raide" title="User:Raide">Raide</a> 03:39, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

<dd>Re mistranslated quick save / quick load / ... -&gt; will fix.
</dd>
<dd>Re formatting problems with TIPS: See my comments on formatting 
instructions. It's necessary to place manual linebreaks (%N) to force an
 early break (such as between "Personal Space" and "The region ...". 
It's necessary to place manual pagebreaks (%P) for every pagebreak. But 
once the manual pagebreaks and are placed, I can let R11 take care of 
inserting ordinary linebreaks on its own.

<dd>Re 33p, overly long title names: It'll be necessary to rewrite the scene names to something shorter.
</dd>
<dd>Re 34, 35, 37, 38, L( garbage, not sure what's wrong. Fix may be a 
matter of rewriting scene names. Does it happen with every scene name,

<p>Here's a few things I found while messing around with the new (Aug 22nd) patch.
</p>
<dl>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Odd Line Breaking and Broken Word Wrap
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>060, 085 (can be fixed by solving line breaking problem), 087 (same), 095, 098, 099
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Currently Unknown (can someone with a 100% save file please check these)
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>006, 072, 083, 084, 100 ~ 110
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Misc
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><s>089 still has tl notes in it</s> possibly fixed
</dd>
<dd>037 is meant to be 'pickax'
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>For some reason, I have white boxes popping up instead of spaces in several of the titles. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/TKS0v.png">[25]</a> Mostly for the chapter titles, TIPS titles and in the lyrics in the jukebox. It also happens with words containing umlauts <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/KOpi9.png">[26]</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/u6GXB.png">[27]</a>. However, I don't get them for things like the shortcuts menu <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/mCRP7.png">[28]</a>. I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium (32bit) if that helps at all.
</li>
<li>Titles still aren't fixed yet <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/bKJH9.png">[29]</a>.
 We can either somehow hack it so that it goes on two lines instead of 
one (if that's even possible...) or prune them, and include the original
 full titles in a seperate txt file. The TIP describing the meanings 
behind the titles will have both the original and our version in it 
side-by-side. Sound good everyone? (Also, I'll do the pruning. I've 
still got time to kill.)
</li>
<li>Saw an instance of the font doing weird things in the Jukebox here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/DlPpB.png">[30]</a>. Also, any chance we could have the English tl instead of Romaji during the vocal songs? <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://imgur.com/YqpcF.png">[31]</a> (also note the lyrics going outside of the frame a little).
</li>
<li>Right-click menus are great (except the titles but I've already mentioned those lol). Well done on these.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And I think that's it - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 18:45, 27 August 2010 (CDT)
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay:
<dl>
<dd><ul>
<li> I made a big change to my TIPS processing program that should avoid
 some of the weird wordwrap problems. Will release an updated version 
soon.
</li>
<li> Install the [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?5yojt870lbmlog9">image/font patch</a>] to fix the spaces and bad umlauts problem.
</li>
<li> Titles will have to be cropped to 31 or fewer characters to fix the
 "garbage occurs after the title name" elsewhere. List the abbreviated 
and full names in the appropriate TIPS. Start pruning.
</li>
<li> Will look into Jukebox problem. Putting the translation for lyrics can be done. Replace them in the init.txt.B file. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 19:11, 27 August 2010 (CDT)

<dd>Excellent! And the patch worked a treat too, thanks! I'll get 
pruning and changing lyrics and stuff tomorrow, after I've had a nice

 Insanity%N and the rest of the TIPS don't. Those double Sociology or

<dd> This version has the first new version of mac.afs in ages, and I 
made it instead of Pengvado. I'm not totally confident I fully 
understand his code, so be sure to back up the old mac.afs (step 1).
</dd>
<dd> Installing it:
<dl>
<dd> 1) Rename existing FILE/mac.afs to FILE/mac-peng.afs.
</dd>
<dd> 2) Unpack zipfile to your Remember11 directory.
</dd>
<dd> 3) Move mac.afs and init-rp.bin to FILE/
</dd>
<dd> 4) Run R11-rp.exe
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd> Okay. With EXE strings, I have to handle each string separately, so
 I copy them by hand to my modding program. Because that line was 
modified in place (instead of making a copy below it and changing the 
copy), I didn't realize it had been changed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 15:45, 27 August 2010 (CDT)

The key configuration menu is a holdover from the PS2 version. What do 
the various buttons mean?
My tentative version is Circle Button = "Forward", X Button = "Show 
Background", Triangle Button = "History", Square Button = "Menu", L1 
Button = "Show Background", L2 button = "Forward", R1 Button = "Fast 
mode", R2 Button = "Fast Mode", R3 button = "Quick Save", Start = "Skip

 clashes with Pengvado's versions). Let me know if you see any pattern

The r11-rp from the first one "works," and yes, the TIPS appear out of order. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a>

<p>Quick question regarding the text speeds and such. I'm just wondering
 if there will be some selection such as in "Ever 17" where the speed 
syncs with the spoken Japanese. I understand that what you changed 
before dealt with this, but will people who play have such an option? 
Only asking because it was pretty cool in "Ever 17" since it synced up 
and all and would be nice to see again. -Chris
</p>
<dl>
<dd> There is such an option in the game engine, but I disabled it 
because it would be annoying to implement. The speeds are stored in 
terms of milliseconds per letter, and the translation obviously has 
different numbers of letters per textblock, so it isn't synced. If you 
can reverse engineer the part of the script format pertaining to the 
speeds, then I will try updating them. But I don't want to do any more 
groveling through undocumented binary formats than necessary. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Pengvado&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pengvado (page does not exist)">Pengvado</a> 04:41, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

<dd> Exactly what parts of the file format do you understand / which 
parts haven't you figured out yet? If you send me a list, I'll take a 
crack at deciphering what's left. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 01:41, 8 April 2010 (UTC)

<dd> A script file consists of a bunch of binary data, followed by a 
bunch of sjis strings. I can extract the strings without knowing 
anything about the binary part; and once I know the locations of all the
 strings, I can grep the binary part for pointers to the strings and 
update those too. That's enough to replace all the text in the game.
</dd>
<dd> I have to assume that the binary part specifies the backgrounds and
 character sprites and voices to be presented along with each line, and 
any movies and transitions, and which line or script to goto next for 
nonlinear flow, and so on. But I can't parse any of that; the most hint I
 can offer is that the location of the string pointers should tell you 
approximately where the metadata for each line is. My sourcecode is in 
the patch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Pengvado&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pengvado (page does not exist)">Pengvado</a> 22:33, 9 April 2010 (UTC)

<dd> Hmmm... Sounds like you don't have anything I didn't already have, 
then. (Note: I don't have a copy of R11 (what's a good place to get 
it?), so I've been studying Hirameki's Ever17) I'm not so sure that it 
uses that fancy of a method. Is it possible that there's a real simple 
method (such as, display letters at a constant rate, spread over the 
duration of the wavefile)? Ever17 at least appears to be that way. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 21:33, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

<dd> Now I'm confused. I assumed that the desync was due to english 
taking more letters than japanese. But I re-ran the experiment, and 
found that ascii lines are displayed 2.6x too slow (regardless of how 
long or short the text or voice is), and kanji lines are displayed 1.2x 
too slow. So it seems that automatic synchronization code exists, it's 
just broken. That makes it closer to fixable, and I'll have a look. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Pengvado&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pengvado (page does not exist)">Pengvado</a> 23:29, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

 mostly break the scripts into individual opcodes. Have you fixed the 
problem with TIPS? If not, this might help with getting that working. 
Also, if you have a group logo, you could use this to add it to the

Just tried the "Aug 4, 2010 TIPS and .exe strings" but it prompts for 
"Please Insert DVD", doesn't seem to do this if I run the original 
R11.exe file. Even if I insert the DVD it still asks for it, am I 
missing something in the process, like an incorrect version or 
something? Thanks! -TBG 24:25, 08 August 2010 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Also, one problem I'm noticing that will become much more serious 
later if we don't address it now is the issue of tenses. Given the 
rather temporal/perspective-ish nature of Remember11, whether something 
is past tense or present is extremely important, and many sections seem 
to arbitrarily mix the two. If one tense is intended, we're going to 
need to stick with that tense for as long as it applies rather than 
confuse the reader. -- DS
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, on this topic, I think sticking with past tense exclusively may
 do the job. First-person present tense can get rather awkward in some 
cases, and its generally hard to go wrong with past. -- DS
<dl>
<dd>I've been having some problems with it, though. In most cases, 
putting past tense in a sentence won't cause any problems, but in some 
cases, it just doesn't fit with the rest of the context, especially with
 CO1_12, where past tense doesn't work with half the text. Switching 
between past and present tense is very confusing, but finding a way to 
change the text into one single tense is just as confusing, and to do 
it, we'd probably have to change the entire text, which probably isn't a
 good idea. Any help on this? --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:MuzikalNotes" title="User:MuzikalNotes">MuzikalNotes</a> 01:47, 11 December 2008 (UTC)

<dd>Um, can a new insertion patch be made? I'd check it out, but I'd 
rather not spoil anything I haven't yet played in the game &gt;.&gt; But
 usually, it should be possible. In the case that the whole text is 
written in a completely different way, like at the end of PR_03, I think
 we can just ignore the past tense, as it doesn't seem to cause any 
problem and it fits in perfectly (that whole block of text when Satoru 
falls off the building is all present tense). Otherwise, we should take a
 look at it, it must be possible. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/24.132.140.5" title="Special:Contributions/24.132.140.5">24.132.140.5</a> 07:27, 11 December 2008 (UTC) Er, whoops, wasn't logged in.

<dd>No, not taking punctuation off. The punctuation wasn't there in the

really weird when a lot of sentences don't end with punctuation...so I 
was talking about adding in punctuation where there isn't any in

<dd>I see that most of the lines in the TIPS (especially the character 
bios) have no full stops at the end (period). Single words and short 
phrases can pass without the period (e.g. Favorite color: Yellow), but 
sentence descriptions look awkward without full stops. The present 
treatment on this case is not uniform (sometimes a sentence in the 
translation ends in a punctuation, sometimes it does not, regardless of 
the presence of punctuations in the original Japanese text). What's the 
verdict on this? -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">cloudscream</a> 5 June 2010

<p>Onee-chan, ne, un, yoroshiku. How much untranslated Japanese are we 
going to leave in the script? Although I agree with suffixes and very 
common stuff like 'onee-chan' remaining untranslated, I think 'ne' and 
'un' are a bit much to leave untranslated, and leaving things like 
'yoroshiku' untranslated just seems like complete overkill, IMO. A 
translation is meant for the people who don't know Japanese, not the 
people who DO know Japanese &gt;.&gt; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:VDZ" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 21:51, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

<dd>I'll put my 2 cents in on this but in no way does this mean we 
should definitely do it my way. I personally believe there should be no 
japanese whatsoever in the translation unless there's just no way to 
translate it properly to english. So no onee-chan, no ne, no yoroshiku 
... etc. -- Chewy

<dd>"Onee-san," "Onii-san," etc. are substantially awkward forms of

very strongly about, as you can probably see.

<dd> I agree, "brother" and "sister" are very awkward ways to address 
your sibling in English. However, as a translator, you can always move 
further away from that literal translation and instead use the 
character's name, or if there's a -chan suffix make up a cuter sounding 
nickname from the character's name... that kind of thing. I think it 
carries much more of an emotional impact when translated into English 
that way than simply putting it in Japanese. This of course depends 
heavily on the material being translated and may not always be 
appropriate. -- Chewy

<dd> I am very strongly against the idea of translating suffixes. 
There's just too much that gets lost in translation if you remove them. 
The Onee-chan could usually be translated though...but not in this case.
 Yuni is referring to Kokoro as 'onee-chan', but she isn't really his 
sister (just a random person he just met). So translating it as 'sister'
 would sound very weird. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:VDZ" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 05:28, 24 September 2008 (UTC)

<p>Guys, it depends highly on the context of the thing being translated.
 There are cases where it's most appropriate to not leave any Japanese 
in at all, and there are cases where it helps with subtext to leave 
things like titles and honorifics in japanese. That being said, leaving 
stuff like "ne," "un," "yoroshiku" untranslated is just bad (or lazy) 
translating. -- too lazy to log in, so let's leave it anonymous.

</p>
<dl>
<dd>An old matter to discuss, but I'm also against translating suffixes.
 It would be best to do literal translation and keep the honorifics and 
"sibling" terminogoloies. It's better to leave them in. Even under 
extreme cases. A lot of connotation exist within them, and to translate 
them into English would be poor due to a lack of, shall we say, 
equivalence that can match its meaning. It will generally sound sound 
awkward in many situations/context if it were translated into English. 
And to omit them entirely out would make the translation feel... 
inadequate and cheapen. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Observer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Observer (page does not exist)">Observer</a> 16:12, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

<p>Okay first off, are we definitely editing with British English? I've 
seen alot of spots with British English and a few spots with American 
(such as CO_8 or 9 when she communicates with Satoru). I know I've been 
editing using my (native) American English. I'm fine with using British 
English, I just need to know what to do.
</p><p>Secondly, I think we're pretty close to releasing a partial 
patch. My question is mainly to The_Paper, what are your plans for the 
ellipses? I noticed that you removed my changes for CO3, which I'm fine 
with. I'd just like to know your plans for making the ellipses 
consistent, so I can follow the same rule. I took some freedom (aka very
 literal) while I was the only consistent editor for a few months, but 
that's luckily not the case any more.
</p><p>I'd like to have these questions cleared up before I begin on Satoru's chapter. Thanks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Uroxin" title="User:Uroxin">Uroxin</a> 20:14, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

</p><p>Hey there guys. I don't check this page that regularly, so sorry 
for the delay in response. I've been trying to edit everything to an 
American English standard, so that should be AFAIK taken care of 
completely for the first two days of script; feel free to bust any other
 Brit-isms you catch.
</p><p>And to Uroxin, I wrote some more about this in the ellipses 
section up the page, but I'll now be going with the popular-choice 
method of using ... for the Japanese-script ……; also, I think that 
spaces should be put in after ellipses in the translated script - I know
 the original Japanese doesn't have them, but since Japanese doesn't 
have any spaces at all I think we can make a case for it; I also find it
 really distracting to the eye, which is IMO one of the worst things you
 can do in any translated medium.

for being so diplomatic about it; I was not trying to cause a shitstorm

<p>One thing that's been slightly bothering me (considering I've been 
doing it myself every now and then, even if just for the sake of 
consistency) is how we seemingly try to keep the original punctuation in
 the translations. I'm not sure what your guys' opinion on this is, but I
 think that since the Japanese and English punctuation rules are 
different in quite a number of ways, perhaps we <i>should</i> keep it 
different? What I mean is e.g. these "text............ 
texttext............" kinda ellipses, or things like "———text———" / 
"text——.". To me these just look like leftovers from Japanese and not 
much else; like, you know, the "untidy" feeling of sorts. The same goes 
for the 「」 style quotes; these are most obviously peculiar to Japanese 
and should be totally changed for something like " " or ' ', although I 
think it's maybe okay to use them in cases where e.g. we would leave 
some Japanese text for illustrative purposes, like 「赤受咸青」... So anyway, 
what do you think? - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 13:20, 13 January 2010 (UTC)

<dd>I know what you mean, but still it's a little strange to me that 
only visual novels get translated like that (as in, square quotes and 
whatnot). I've read some translated Japanese books and none of them 
exhibited such traits... Ah well, this is perhaps just me after all.

name suffixes (-san, -kun, -chan, -sama, etc) are probably gone as well.
 The translated books are intended for an audience that probably doesn't
 want to bother with Japanese honorifics, unfamiliar punctuation, etc, 
so they get replaced with rough equivalents in English. However, 
Remember11 will be read almost only by visual novel fans, and we can 
expect them to be familiar with non-English punctuation and things like 
that. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:VDZ" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 16:14, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

<dd> This is a fan translation project, so there will be parts that will
 be localized according to the translator's preference. As for the rest,
 like VDZ said in his post and comments, readers of what we're doing are
 VN fans who will know about what isn't localized anyway. Replacing or 
removal of the punctuation isn't easy. The ellipses and -text- serve to 
better convey the story to the reader, e.g. bringing out the emotions 
etc. It doesn't break the reading if the translation is placed correctly
 on either side. (This has been discussed before, the ellipses have been
 changed to ...)What's important is that our product is able to bring 
out the story fully and clearly and the text is smooth and (near) 
flawless. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Loki" title="User:Loki">Loki</a> 14:08, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Yes. In order to get the text to appear correctly, you'll also need to 
have the tags in the translation. The original text is completely 
replaced with the translated text; any tags that are not copied over to 
the translation are lost. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:VDZ" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 03:30, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

<p>Since the translation moved to Satoru chapter now, I'll bring this up
 again. It's minor stuff, but... it's connected to the above 俺/オレ 
matter, so I'm putting it here. I ran into a couple of yukidoh satoru in
 katakana, and decided to show the difference by writing YUKIDOH SATORU 
in the translation. fast and simple. does anyone have other suggestions?
 Pengvado instead used yuukidou in the small box that shows the name of 
the speaker, so we should decide on what to consistently use to avoid 
any confusion. ah, there is also the fact another name gets to be 
written in katakana... --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Lors" title="User:Lors">lors</a> 14:32, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

<p>In theory, since the font format has been deciphered, there is this 
idea that maybe we can have italics (or in fact anything) by replacing 
some of the characters in the font table. Although even putting the 
technical stuff aside, just thinking about it, it seems rather 
problematic, e.g.
</p>
<ul>
<li>why is it 俺 that must be italicized (or otherwise highlighted) and 
not オレ, seeing as the former is the "proper" way of writing it?
</li>
<li>shouldn't we, then, also think of representations for Kokoro's 私（あたし）...
</li>
<li>...and ワタシ which also shows up at least once?
</li>
<li>last but not least, what would be most suitable representations for each of these?
</li>
</ul>
<p>And even if/when these issues are clear, it would still require a 
rather big effort on all "fronts". So for now, this is only an "idea", 
not even a suggestion. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 14:59, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

<p>In PR_03, there are comments using // instead of just text being put 
in a regular line, like NTX seems to do with his TL comments. How does 
this work? Can we put comment lines under any line by starting them with
 //, without breaking anything? Because if that's the case, it might be 
better to put all translation comments as regular // comments under the 
translated lines instead of putting them directly IN the translated 
line. This way, it doesn't show up in the game, but is still readable

<p>I'd like to point out that the name of tip #88 is still 'That Guy'. 
The original name, アイツ, is a gender-neutral term, whereas the current 
translation implies that 'That Guy' is male. Considering it's not 
impossible for 'That Guy' to be female (in fact, I personally think it's
 female), I think it would be best to replace this with something less 
gender-specific, such as 'That Person'. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:VDZ" title="User:VDZ">VDZ</a> 17:35, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

<dd>IMO we should leave it as is, unless someone can come up with a 
REALLY good replacement. Even though the phrase makes you think of a 
male someone first (and the Japanese is like that too - "aitsu" is 
rarely if ever used in reference to a woman), I think it's explained 
adequately in the story that That Guy isn't necessarily male, or even 
human, so it doesn't matter. If you want to get technical, the original 
use of the word "guy" was gender-neutral anyway. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:The_paper" title="User:The paper">the_paper</a> 05:17, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

district. However, "district" is the usual translation of 郡 in Japan (at
 least from what I've seen); "county" is used in the US and UK and some 
of their past colonies. Please refer to the following sites for the

good for the job). Any help would be much appreciated. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 15:47, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

<dd> Which images do you need to work with? I was able to extract some of them, and they appear to just be wrappers around .PNGs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 16:06, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

<dd>I can compile a list of images that are/may be needed (using Kid 
Tools GUI for the previewing) if that's what you mean, however an actual
 way to just mass-convert the extracted images would be much better; 
e.g. I don't find it necessary to translate building signs and such 
stuff but someone else might want to do those as well. Btw, is backward 
conversion possible too? - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 17:07, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

<dd>Hey guys, I've been following this project for a while (Big fan of 
Ever 17). I'm a professional software engineer. Maybe I can make a quick
 program or something in C# .NET for you guys? If you can, send me 
(thrustingblade@gmail.com) a sample R11 image format and I'll see if I 
can decode it into a more common image format. - TBG 00:34, 18 June 2010

 is what I think we'll (roughly) need. As you can see it's mostly bg.afs
 and bits of ev.afs. There were also some images with stuff like "file 
is not defined" or "dummy file" written over them, as well as something 
that looked like a leftover from the PS2 version to me (gamepad key

even seen them appear ingame. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 06:54, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

 is a Photoshop CS action. Add (record) a save to png / close commands 
at the end of it, then batch process everything. Since PS would only 
save the alpha channel if it's actually used (regardless of user

count out of the image, so you don't need to worry about transparency. 
Unfortunately, although I've produced images which seemingly match R11's
 internal format, R11 is crashing when it tries to display them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 17:50, 25 June 2010 (UTC)

see that unlike the previous pack these have shifted colors (similar to

<dd>Short answer: The files are stored with red and blue components 
interchanged and 50% alpha for some reason. I actually extracted the 
ALBUM.PNG and TITLE.PNG images a while back, so I didn't correct for 
those at the time. I did correct for those two things when extracting 
the bg.afs and ev.afs images. Do you want me to fix those images and 
resend, or can you modify them yourself? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 12:28, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

that'd be super awesome.

</p><p>There is also at least one novel that can be considered a "spiritual successor" of sorts to the Infinity series, namely <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://www.asgard-japan.com/io/">Ｉ／Ｏ RevisionⅡ.</a>
 It's from Regista, a company headed by the very same Takumi Nakazawa 
too. As for the story, it is kind of similar to 12Riven in some aspects:
 a weird (red) lunar eclipse occurs, things start happening, lots and 
lots of philosophic/technical/occult stuff (and I mean <i>lots</i>. 
Enough to say that its TIPS section looks like they stuffed a half of 
Jp. Wikipedia in there (reads like one as well, what's with all the 
constant "hyperlinks" and whatnot)), etc. To be honest, 12Riven didn't 
exactly live up to the Infinity name for me (the latter half of the 
Renmaru route bore me to the bones, just couldn't bring myself to 
continue with the rest...). This, I can't tell for now as I'm just in 
the middle of the first route, but looks definitely more promising. Not 
necessarily for the translating sake, but just because some perhaps 
might be interested.-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 13:52, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, I'll definitely try playing it. I'm a sucker for all this 
philosophic/technical/occult stuff anyway. I took a look and the art 
doesn't really sit well with me but oh well... ah, you should give 
another chance to 12Riven. I too found the Renmaru route a little boring
 and made me stop playing for weeks, but the integral route is 
absolutely insane and worth the time. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Lors" title="User:Lors">lors</a> 14:14, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>lol I'm just saying that my translation is admittedly rough at some 
parts (especially the earlier days) and they're bound to raise a few 
eyebrows. I remember typing stuff that even I found unacceptable and 
just sweeping it aside thinking we could edit it later on (and I even 
found a few typos recently... D:&lt;). I don't know any fan translation 
groups that knowingly released their patch without a proper editing 
phase, and right now our current editors are still working away on the 
first half. Well, I won't stop anyone who doesn't really care about poor
 English, so it depends on Pengvado when he does his next insertion 
update.--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Novice_Translator_X&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Novice Translator X (page does not exist)">Novice Translator X</a> 20:47, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I actually haven't looked over the first day in ages. I don't mean 
to sound super obvious, but the most important thing in editing imo 
(besides spelling and grammar) is to match how the scene is supposed to 
feel (atmosphere, emotion), while keeping the character's personality 
traits in mind (make sure the reader feels what the writer meant for 
them to feel).--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Novice_Translator_X&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Novice Translator X (page does not exist)">Novice Translator X</a> 01:52, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The first day looked pretty decent. My semi inactivity (as I did say
 I'd marathon on the 4th) came from an unfortunate accident at a beach 
involving sunlight (in other words, a terrible sunburn&nbsp;:&lt;). In 
any case, I think the patch shouldn't be released until the script is 
throughly edited. Days 1 and 2 are pretty good (IMO) but there's some 
parts in day 3 that needs refining, and I'm about halfway through day 4 
and that's far from perfect either (haven't gotten past day 4). But in 
any case, I really don't think it'd be a good idea to release a partial 
patch as it is now, as it may undermine credibility. Plus, it's no fun 
to be left on a cliffhanger.&nbsp;:P <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Uroxin" title="User:Uroxin">Uroxin</a> 07:04, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Hello, guys. I'm glad to see that this novel finally have been 
translated and now we can enjoy it on english. I'm russian man and I 
have question: can I use your english text for translating it to 
russian? If so, can I ask some additional questions about? Whether there
 is someone who hacked the FNT2626.FOP from etc.afs or can help me with 
it? Or it is possible to link latin symbols from mac.afs scripts to 
russian shapes from etc.afs/FNT (e.g. through exe)? The problem is that 
russian text coded by shift-jis is too large and scripts becomes more 
than a 64kb limitation. I see only one possible way to resolve the 
problem: to replace latin symbols by cyrillic ones in the novel. With 
these replacements the all russian text will be coded by latin symbols. 
Can someone somehow help me? --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Vizer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Vizer (page does not exist)">Vizer</a> 9:08, 12 June 2010 (UTC)

although most of the time I never bother to log in... So anyway, it was 
me who added this. The reason is——well, the op is a part of the game, 
shouldn't it be translated too at some point in time? Besides, I use 
some After Effects, so I can do the technical part of it if that's okay.

<dd>What can I say? awesome. maybe I'd use another font though, more like the one the characters' names are written in. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Lors" title="User:Lors">lors</a> 12:31, 22 December 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Glad you liked. I have that font too; notice, however, that they're 
using a different one for the characters' quotes themselves. I figured 
out it's pretty much the good old MS Gothic, so I used it for 
consistency. I wouldn't mind changing it if anything, though.

<dd>Why, thank you. Actually - I dunno if I wasn't being clear - both 
the names and the Trickstar thing are already done. (About the initials -
 wow... Well, that certainly wasn't intentional, all I can say. X) ) 
Btw, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://rghost.net/775389">here</a>
 is the current (full) version which uses the recent translations. 
'Works' ingame too, just rename &amp; copy it appropriately (the game 
seems to understand xvid so I used that instead of wmv3).<br>One thing, 
though, is that my so called encoding "skills" are fairly basic; I can 
make a 2-pass xvid in virtualdub but that's mostly it. I'd appreciate it
 if someone knowledgeable could describe a better procedure to me so 
that better quality could be achieved.<br>Other than that, happy holidays everyone.&nbsp;:) Keep up the good work. -<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 22:52, 30 December 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if we want the videos to be equivalent in format to the 
original, we'll have to use the Windows Media VCM encoder (for WMV in 
AVI). Do we know how the game plays back its movies? If it just uses 
DirectShow, we could basically just use MKVs or whatever we want (and 
rename the file to AVI so the filename is the same). Or we could use 
x264 in AVI, however evil that is. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/134.173.60.163" title="Special:Contributions/134.173.60.163">134.173.60.163</a> 00:04, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

<dd> You mean like translating the staff roll? You know... most probably
 won't happen. I can spot at least 3 problems with that, and the biggest
 one of them imho is that the 3 credit sequences that R11 has (yes, it 
has 3...) kind of amount to 750-something mb in total&nbsp;:) That'd 
make quite a patch, don't you think? Of course, there is also the 
Chaos;Head way of doing things, I mean when it's sort of realtime-subbed
 during the patch installation; however, while this helps to avoid the 
size problem, it can introduce further complications as far as I heard 
(harder on the programming side, can cause the installation to not work 
for some people and so on). Also, making subtitles (i.e. Substation) is 
not even my field really. -<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:N.H." title="User:N.H.">N.H.</a> 21:51, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

<dd> Ah, that. Well I can't say yet. For one it's still extra 89 mb... 
Despite what I'm doing I'm actually rather against blowing the size up 
very much. For now, I'd like to wait for the general opinion; if more 
guys agree that it's needed then I'll do it. Hope that's okay.<br>In other news, I've fixed Kokoro's name in mv14/mv15.

actually have a personal host that is not temporary like rghost or

</p><p>ORBEN: First, put four tildes (~) after your post.
</p><p>Remember 11 doesn't use the system font rendering, so your locale
 shouldn't matter at all. Is your version of etc.afs modified in any 
way? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 19:22, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

</p><p>etc.afs comes with Remember11 and is located in the FILE/ or 
FILES/ directory. My image translation patch modifies it, but should 
affect the fonts. Have you done anything beyond a stock install? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 15:35, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
</p><p>all i did was to copy the mac.afs file from the patch to the file
 directory and r11.exe to the remember11 folder and then i replaced them
 with the original files but i still had the same problem so i know that
 the problen is not related to the patch and i also used your image

</p><p>Do you have a file called orig.etc.afs or something like that in your FILES/ directory?
- If so, delete etc.afs and rename orig.etc.afs to etc.afs. Check whether fonts are now displayed correctly. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 17:45, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's just for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the 
translation, especially on the rough parts (puns, localization, 
"untranslatable phrases," etc.). A couple or dozen of notes, it doesn't

<dd>There's no need for that. Frankly it'd just be a huge waste of time.
 If this was a pun heavy comedy game, you'd have a point, but everything
 weird or bizarre is already explained in game (see Kagome song 
explaination, TIPS etc). Nobody would benefit from such a list unless 
they were learning Japanese (in which case they'd go play the game in 
Japanese with a dictionary) and it might even make the translators 
themselves look bad. So yeah, bad idea imo. - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Sheeta" title="User:Sheeta">Sheeta</a> 15:46, 17 August 2010 (CDT)
<dl>
<dd>Almost every fan translation out there has translation notes. It's 
not to help those learning Japanese or whatnot, it is to preserve the 
integrity of the translation, to explain certain deviations of the 
translated text from the original. It takes some time and effort, but 
certainly it's not a waste. --<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Krdskrm" title="User:Krdskrm">Krdskrm</a> 23:01, 17 August 2010 (CDT)

<p>Because these games just don't work too well on Linux, I'm working on
 an open-source reimplementation of the engine. It should work on PCs 
(including, yes, Linux), and hopefully also on Android, with vastly 
lower CPU load. (Credentials: I did the Dwarf Fortress SDL port. I'm 
also a working programmer, not a college kid. I can do this.&nbsp;;)
</p><p>I'm basing my work mostly off never7dec, which gave me sufficient
 hints to the file format that I can figure the rest out myself, but.. I
 thought I should ask - if you have any other documentation or tools 
that might be useful, could I have a look?
</p><p>I'm not going to ask any of you to do any actual *work* (aside

</p><p>Considering that the Remember11 format is drastically different 
from the Never7 format, and that Never7dec only analyzes a small portion
 of the never7 format (EVERYTHING in the never7dec / never7enc package 
comes to 52 k, while Never7win_3d.exe is 233 K and R11.exe is 800 K), 
and the slightest look at the files would have made that clear... Well, 
try [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pastebin.com/ryNxmSxY">this</a>]
 decompiler. It'll at least be a better starting point. (Given the 
number of "if (0x1000 == 0x1000) ..." I've found, I'm pretty sure my 
understanding of "if" is wrong.) I'll go through the rest of my records 
for anything else that might be of use. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 15:29, 12 September 2010 (CDT)
</p><p>Right, thanks. Yeah, mainly I was using it for hints to the

know no Perl. This should be fun.

Well, I'd better get down to this. Is altinitbin.pl anything important, 
and can I have a copy of that too so I can try running this? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Baughn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Baughn (page does not exist)">Baughn</a> 11:41, 14 September 2010 (CDT)
</p><p>altinitbin.pl is a Perl-readable version of init.bin. I added it 
to the decompiler fairly recently because it would enable me to use 
prettier names (such as "Didn't drink coffee BAD" instead of "high flag 
#xxx"). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 12:04, 14 September 2010 (CDT)
</p><p>First, Pengvado's notes are at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/http://akuvian.org/remember11/translation_patch">http://akuvian.org/remember11/translation_patch</a> . My own working material is available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?v5u2t3r4ca89254">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?v5u2t3r4ca89254</a>
 . You might also want to look at the source to xlvns (Leaf interpreter)
 or ONScripter for general tips on visual novel engines. Alternately, if
 you want to try a simpler project, you might try reimplementing the 
Never 7 engine. In addition to being a smaller executable, it has a 
feature called "Append Story" which allows users to create stories using
 the engine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711104915/https://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=User:Roger_Pepitone" title="User:Roger Pepitone">Roger Pepitone</a> 13:48, 15 September 2010 (CDT)

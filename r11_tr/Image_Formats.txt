Bytes   4-  7: DWORD Address of the start of the subtable (= 0x80)
Bytes   8- 11: DWORD Header length (file start through end of subtable)
Bytes  12- 15: DWORD start of subimage files  (FilesStart)
Bytes  16- 19: (same as previous)
Bytes  20- 23: total length of file

Subtable:
Bytes Subtable_starts +    0 -  3: DWORD number of subimages  (NSubimages)
Bytes ......          +    4 -  7: DWORD 0
Bytes ......          +    8 - 11: x resolution A
Bytes ......          +   12 - 15: y resolution B

Each record is:
    DWORD 7 (number of dwords in record?)
    DWORD unk_1
    WORD sub_x_offset

    WORD sub_xres
    WORD sub_yres      (dimensions of subimage)
    WORD full_xres_1
    WORD full_yres_1   (one resolution)   
    WORD full_xres_2
    WORD full_yres_2   (another resolution)
    DWORD sub_offset   (where image data starts in file)

『私はカモメ』%K%P
"I'm a seagull."
//Seagull = kamome

これは世界初の女性宇宙飛行士ワレンチナ・テレシコワの言葉だ。%K%P
These were the words uttered by the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova.

旧ソ連の宇宙船ヴォストーク６号に乗り込んだ彼女は、ひとり、完全な静寂と虚無に支配された宇宙空間を漂いながら……%K%P
All alone aboard the former Soviet Union spaceship Vostok 6, floating in the void of space, a place of complete silence and emptiness...

その心もとない孤独感と……%K%P
With a hollow feeling of isolation upon her...

同時にすべての束縛から逃れたことによる解放感を、１羽の『カモメ』になぞらえて地球の管制官に送ったのだった。%K%P
Yet still able to draw the parallel between herself and a seagull to express the liberating feeling of breaking free from everything.

『私はカモメ』……素敵な表現だと思う。%K%P
"I'm a seagull"... such beautiful words.

私には、そんな気の利いた言いまわしは思い浮かばない。%K%P
If it were me, I'd never have been able to come up with something so clever.

少々の皮肉を込めて言い表わすとするなら、さしづめ『私は籠女』とでもいったところだろうか。%K%P
I'd probably try being sarcastic and say that, "I'm a girl trapped in a cage". Though, if you think about it, would that really be sarcasm?
//just nitpicking again, but can anyone think of a way to preserve the kamome/kagome pun? - the_paper
//"I'm a sealed girl"? Still lame, but...
//"I'm a SEAled GUrLL" I think the "sealed girl" suggestion above is fine...

狭い籠の中に閉じ込められたひとりの女の子。%K%P
A lonely girl locked away inside a tiny, narrow cage.

私は今、天国に一番近い場所にいる。%K%P
Right now, I'm somewhere as close to heaven as I'll ever be.

高度３万３千フィートの空の上に……。%K%P
33,000 feet up in the air....

？？「うしろのしょーめんだーれ？」%K%P
Who's that behi――ind you?

突如、私の視界は遮られた。%K%P
Suddenly, the world around me disappears.

誰かが後ろの座席から手をまわして私の両目を覆っている。%K%P
Someone from the seat behind me has covered both my eyes with their hands.

？？「うしろのしょーめんだーれ？」%K%P
Who's that behi――ind you?

こころ「…………」%K%P
......

？？「うしろのしょーめんだーれ？」%K%P
Who's that behi――ind you?

私は……。%K%p
I....

手を振りほどく
Pull the hands away.

『天使さん？』
"An angel?"

『誰かなぁ？』
"Who, I wonder?"

速やかに手を振りほどき、背後を返り見た。%K%P
I quickly pulled the hands away from my eyes and turned around.

少年「ちぇっ、つまんないのぉ～」%K%P
Tch, you're no fun～

少年「ノリが悪いなぁ、お姉ちゃん」%K%P
You're in a bad mood, huh, Onee-chan?

そこには見ず知らずの少年がいた。%K%P
Behind me was a boy whom I'd never seen before.

背もたれから身を乗り出すようにして、無邪気な笑みを浮かべている。%K%P
He peeked over the back of my seat with an innocent smile on his face.

こころ「え、えっと……きみは……誰？」%K%P
Uhh... emm... who... are you?

少年「だからぁ、それを当てるゲームをやってたんじゃないかぁ」%K%P
See, that's why I wanted to play the guessing game with you.

こころ「ゲーム？」%K%P
A game?

少年「知らないの？　かごめかごめ」%K%P
You don't know it? Kagome Kagome?

こころ「それは、知ってるけど……」%K%P
I know the game, but...

少年「ねえ？　ここ、空いてる？」%K%P
Hey, is this seat empty?

少年は私の隣、窓側の座席を手のひらでたたいた。%K%P
He thumped the headrest of the window seat next to mine with the palm of his hand.
//old: He dusted off the headrest of the window seat right beside mine.

少年「って言うか、空いてるよね？」%K%P
It's empty, right?

少年「途中で乗って来る人も……」%K%P
And it doesn't look like... 

少年「いなさそうだし」%K%P
...anyone else will be coming on board any time soon.

窓の外をのぞき込むようにして、彼はそう言った。%K%P
He said as he peered out of the window.

少年「到着まで、まだだいぶかかると思うよ？」%K%P
I think it'll be a while until we get there.

少年「なにしろ、日本列島のてっぺんまで行くんだからね」%K%P
We ARE flying to the far edge of the Japanese Islands, you know.

こころ「でも……」%K%P
But...

少年「『旅は道連れ世は情け』」%K%P
"In traveling, companionship. In life, compassion",

少年「『袖すりあうも和尚の霊』って言うじゃん？」%K%P
"Every new meeting happens because of the spirits of priests"... that's what they say, right?

こころ「和尚の、霊？」%K%P
The spirits... of priests?

戸惑う私をよそに、彼はするりと隣の座席に身体を滑り込ませてきた。%K%P
The boy quickly slipped into the window seat beside me.

少年「はじめまして」%K%P
Nice to meet you.

ゆに「ぼく、楠田ゆに」%K%P
My name is Kusuda Yuni.

ゆに「生年月日は１９９９年１０月１９日、１１歳、天秤座」%K%P
I'm 11 years old, my birthday is on October 19, 1999, and my sign is Libra.

ゆに「血液型はＡＢ型」%K%P
My blood-type is AB.

ゆに「だからかどうかはわからないけど、よくひとに『変わってるね』って言われます」%K%P
I don't know if that's the reason or not, but a lot of people tell me I'm weird.
//old: I don't know if I should really bring this up, but people often call me strange.

ゆに「好きな食べ物はエスカルゴとキノコのバターソテーで、嫌いな食べ物は茶碗蒸しの中に入ってるギンナンです」%K%P
My favorite food is escargot sauteed in butter with mushrooms, and my least favorite food is ginko nut custard.

ゆに「んで、お姉ちゃんは？」%K%P
What about you, Onee-chan?

こころ「私は……」%K%P
I...

まくしたてるような勢いに圧倒され、私は言葉を詰まらせた。%K%P
Defeated by his overwhelming vigor, I was unable to say anything.

『ゆに』と名乗ったその少年は、何の遠慮もはばかりもなく、ぐいぐいと私の傍らに擦り寄ってくる。%K%P
Then the boy, without fear or reservation, came up close to me.

まいったなぁ……。%K%P
Oh brother....

こういうの、私苦手なのよねぇ……。%K%P
I'm not really good at dealing with stuff like this....

ゆに「どうしたの？」%K%P
What's wrong?

ちょこんと小首を傾げる少年。%K%P
The boy tilted his head.

私は視線をそらし、彼の肩越しへと目を向けた。%K%P
I averted my gaze, looking over his shoulder instead.

窓の外の雲海は、世界をすっぽりと覆い尽くすようにどこまでも果てしなく広がっていた。%K%P
As I looked past the sea of clouds, the world seemed to go on forever... boundless and free...

こころ「う～ん、そうねぇ～」%K%P
Hmm～, let's see～

こころ「ここは雲の上だから、天使さんが悪戯でもしにきたのかな？」%K%P
We're above the clouds, right? So... maybe an angel came to play a prank?

？？「うわっ、なにそれ、オヤジギャグですか？」%K%P
Uwaa, what was that?! Sounds like the kind of joke my grandfather would make...

？？「さむぅ～」%K%P
So laaame～

少しだけカチンときた。%K%P
I heard a small clink.

私は眼前の手を引き剥がすと、勢いよく振り返った。%K%P
As soon as the hands covering my eyes were removed, I quickly turned around.

少年「ふひひひひぃ～ん……」%K%P
Hihihi...

少年「うぃっす、こんちぃ！」%K%P
'Sup? G'day!

そこには見ず知らずの少年がいた。%K%P
There was an unfamiliar boy I had never seen before.

背もたれから身を乗り出すようにして、無邪気な笑みを浮かべている。%K%P
He was leaning over the backrest with an innocent smile.

こころ「ごめん、お姉ちゃん忙しいんだ」%K%P
Sorry, Onee-chan's busy right now.

こころ「退屈なのはわかるけど、遊ぶんならママに相手してもらってね？」%K%P
I know you're bored, but if you want to play, play with your mama instead, okay?

少年「ママ？　ママなんていないよ」%K%P
Mama? Mama isn't here.

こころ「じゃあパパは？　パパの席はどこ？」%K%P
Then how about your papa? Where's your papa's seat?

少年は黙って首を振った。%K%P
The boy didn't say anything and just shook his head.

こころ「えっ？　ってことは、まさかひとりで？」%K%P
Eh? That means... It can't be... Are you alone?

今度は首を縦に振る。%K%P
This time he nodded his head. 

こころ「きみ、小学生だよねぇ？」%K%P
You're an elementary school student, right?

少年「うん」%K%P
Yeah.

こころ「へぇ～、小学生なのにひとりで飛行機に乗れちゃうなんてすごいじゃない」%K%P
Eeh～, traveling alone on an airplane even though you're so young, that sure is something, isn't it?

少年「すごくなんかないよ～」%K%P
It's not that impressive～

とは言いながらも、まんざらではなさそうだった。%K%P
Even though he said that, you could tell he was quite pleased at being praised.

照れ笑いがあどけなくて愛らしい。%K%P
He seemed very innocent and charming.

先程の辛辣な言葉づかいも、子どもならではの虚勢だったのかと思うと憎たらしさも愛嬌へと変わる。%K%P
If not for the sharp tongue I had heard earlier, I would've been under the complete influence of his childish charms.

その人心を掌握するかのごときアルカイックスマイルは、果たして天性のものなのか、あるいは狡猾なる企みを秘めた罠なのか。%K%P
Now then, is this charming Archaic smile an attribute of his true face? Or is it just a cute facade hiding his wicked nature? 
//note: I left the reference to the Archaic smile in the sentence, as it seems deliberate - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_smile
//also note that Archaic is supposed to be capitalized.

いずれにせよ、二十歳も終盤へと差しかかり、%K%P
Even though, at my age, you'd think I could immediately tell whether a kid was putting on an act or being sincere.

世の中の酸いも甘いも（ある程度）知ってしまった私にとって、彼の穢れなき微笑みは羨望さえ抱かせるに充分だった。%K%P
But right now, as someone who's experienced both the sweetness and the bitterness of this world, I see in his undefiled smile a side of him that I wanted to be real.

こころ「いくつなの？」%K%P
How old are you?

尋ねた私の口元は、いつしか自然にゆるんでいた。%K%P
I asked a question, not quite sure when I had become so talkative.

少年「１１……５番目の素数だよ」%K%P
11... it's the fifth prime number!

素数？%K%P
Prime number?

根っからの文系人間の私にとって、その言葉はあまりにも遠かった。%K%P
As a liberal arts student, that expression wasn't one that I heard often.

とは言え、さすがに定義ぐらいは知っている。%K%P
That being said, I at least still remembered the definition.

『１』とその数自体でしか割り切れない正の整数のこと。ただし『１』は含めないものとする。%K%P
A positive integer that can only be divided by the number 1 and itself.  However, the number 1 itself is not included.

少年「ぼく、素数が好きなんだ」%K%P
I like prime numbers.

少年「因数を２つだけしか持たないから」%K%P
Because they only have two factors.

少年「１つでも３つ以上でもなく……２つ……」%K%P
Not one, not three... but two...

彼は相変わらずニコニコと微笑んでいた。%K%P
He has a big smile on his face, as always...
//I know that's a literal translation of "aikawarazu", but would she say this about someone she's just met?
//What about using "again," because the boy just smiled earlier?

私には埒外の分野――。愛想笑いを浮かべて見せるのが精一杯だった。%K%P
A realm that was now forever out of my reach――the ability to give an ingratiating smile like that with all my might.

私の専門は『ソスウ』や『インスウ』ではなく%N『%TS000ソシオロジィ%TE』や『%TS001インサニティ%TE』なのだ。%K%P
You know, my specialty isn't "factors" or "prime numbers", but rather "%TS000sociology%TE" and "%TS001insanity%TE".

少年「お姉ちゃんは、素数じゃないね？」%K%P
Onee-chan's age isn't a prime number, is it?

ふいに、彼はそう言った。%K%P
He said that suddenly.

少年「お姉ちゃん、二十歳でしょう？」%K%P
Onee-chan is twenty, right?

こころ「な、なんで、知ってるの？」%K%P
H-how did you know?

少年「さあ～、なんでだろうねぇ～」%K%P
Hmmm～, I wonder～

彼は悪戯っぽく首を傾げて見せた。%K%P
He mischievously tilted his head for me to see.

ゆに「ぼく、楠田ゆに」%K%P
I'm Kusuda Yuni.

ゆに「よろしくね？」%K%P
Let's try to get along, 'kay?

背もたれにちょこんとアゴを乗せて右手を差し伸べてくる。%K%P
He rested his chin on the head-rest behind me and stuck his right hand out.

私は動揺しながらも引き寄せられるようにその手を取った。%K%P
I shook it.

とても小さな手のひらだった。%K%P
His palm was very small.

それは欠落した何かのカケラがあるべき場所へと還るように、私の手のひらにしっくりとなじんだ。%K%P
It fit surprisingly well into my own palm, as if returning a missing fragment to its rightful place.

こころ「う～ん、誰かなぁ？」%K%P
Umm, who could it be?

？？「誰でしょう？」%K%P
Who could it be?

こころ「誰だろう？」%K%P
I wonder who it is?

？？「誰だと思う？」%K%P
Who do you think it is?

この旅に同伴者はいない。私はひとりでこの飛行機に乗ったのだ。%K%P
No one's traveling with me on this flight. I boarded this plane by myself.

心当たりはまるでなかった。%K%P
I don't have the slightest idea.

ただ耳元に届くその声は、変声期を迎える前の少年のそれを思わせた。%K%P
Judging by the voice, it was the boy sitting in the seat behind me.

まぶたを覆ったふたつの手のひらも小さい。%K%P
The palms that covered my eyes were pretty small.

こころ「ダメだぁ～、降参降参！」%K%P
Okay... I give up, I give up!

私は両手を高く掲げると、手首をくるくるとまわしておどけて見せた。%K%P
I raised both of my arms and spun around my wrists playfully.

？？「ほんとに降参？」%K%P
Are you sure you give up?

こころ「うん」%K%P
Yup.

？？「しょーがない。じゃあ教えてあげよぉー！」%K%P
Well then...  I guess I'll tell you!

？？「正解は……」%K%P
The correct answer is...

ゆに「楠田ゆにくんでしたぁー！」%K%P
Kusuda Yuni-kun!

振り向くと、そこには予想通り小学生と思しき少年がいた。%K%P
Turning around, I found, as I had expected, an elementary-schooler who was apparently a boy.

背もたれから身を乗り出すようにして、無邪気な笑みを浮かべている。%K%P
He was leaning over the headrest with an innocent smile. 

『楠田ゆにくんでしたぁー！』と彼は言ったが、その名前に聞き覚えはなかったし、顔立ちにも見覚えはなかった。%K%P
"Kusuda Yuni-kun!" is what he said... I didn't remember hearing that name anywhere, nor did I remember seeing his face before.

こころ「そっかぁ、ゆにくんって言うんだぁ」%K%P
I see. Yuni-kun, is it?

こころ「かわいい名前だね？」%K%P
That's a really cute name.

ゆに「ありがとう」%K%P
Thanks.

ゆに「友達には『ユニシロ』とか『ユニットバス』とかって言われて、よくからかわれるけどね」%K%P
My friends often tease me by calling me "Yunishiro" or "Unit Bus", though.
//??? seems a like a legitimate straightforward translation but "what the?!" 
//maybe skip this line altogether if it won't have any impact on the later story - or keep it "for the lulz"

はにかんだ笑顔が人懐っこくて愛らしい。%K%P
His shyly smiling face was friendly and charming.

ゆに「ねえ、お姉ちゃん？　隣いってもいい？」%K%P
Hey, Onee-chan?  Can I sit next to you?

ゆに「空いてるんでしょう？」%K%P
The seat here is free, right?

私はチラリと腕時計に目を向けた。%K%P
I took a glance at my wristwatch.

目的地に到着するまで、まだだいぶ時間がある。%K%P
There was still a lot of time before we would reach our destination.

こころ「おいで？」%K%P
You mean here?

私が窓側の座席をポンポンとたたくと……%K%P
I patted the seat by the window...

ゆにと名乗ったその少年は、椅子取りゲームでもするみたいに素早く私の隣に滑り込んできた。%K%P
The boy who had introduced himself as Yuni pounced into the chair next to me as if he was in the middle of playing musical chairs, and the music had just come to an abrupt stop.

こころ「ねえ？　ひとつ気になったことがあるんだけど、訊いてもいいかなぁ？」%K%P
Hey! There was something I was curious about...

ゆに「なーに？」%K%P
What is it?

こころ「ゆにくん、さっき『かごめ歌』の中で『夜明けの%TS002晩%TEに』って唄ってたでしょう？」%K%P
When you were singing the "Kagome song" earlier: you sang "yoake no ban"――"%TS002evening%TE lit by the dawn", right?

こころ「私の記憶が正しければ、確かあそこの歌詞は『月夜の晩に』だったと思うんだけど……」%K%P
If I remember correctly... I think that part should be "tsukiyo no ban"――"evening lit by the moonlight"...

ゆに「月夜の晩？」%K%P
Evening lit by the moonlight?

こころ「そう。だって『夜明けの晩』じゃ、意味が通らないじゃない」%K%P
Yes. Because "evening lit by the dawn" doesn't really make much sense...

こころ「明け方なのか夕方なのか、太陽は東にあるのか西にあるのか……ね？」%K%P
When it's dawn, the sun RISES in the east, and at night, the sun sets in the west... right?

ゆに「お姉ちゃんが子どもの頃は、そうやって唄ってたの？」%K%p
So is that the way you sang it when you were a kid, Onee-chan?

『夜明けの晩に』と唄っていた
I sang "Evening lit by the dawn" 

『月夜の晩に』と唄っていた
I sang "Evening lit by the moonlight"

『かごめ歌』を唄ったことがない
...No, I guess that's not quite how the "Kagome song" goes...

こころ「ううん……『夜明けの晩に』って唄ってた」%K%P
Funny... now I'm pretty sure "evening lit by the dawn" sounds right in its place.

ゆに「じゃあどうして『月夜の晩』だと思ったの？」%K%P
Then, why did you think it went "evening lit by the moonlight"?

こころ「うん、ちょっとね、前に読んだ物語の中にそう書いてあったから」%K%P
Hmm, well, it was written that way in some book I read a while ago...

こころ「うん」%K%P
Yup!

私は大きくうなずいた。%K%P
I gave a confident nod.

こころ「私、実は『かごめかごめ』ってやったことないんだ」%K%P
Actually, I've never played Kagome Kagome before.

こころ「もしかしたら、記憶にないだけかも知れないけどね」%K%P
Or it might be that I just don't remember doing it...

こころ「ちっちゃい頃のことなんて、よく覚えてないし……」%K%P
I don't really remember a lot of stuff I used to do when I was little...

ゆに「じゃあどうして『月夜の晩』だと思ったの？」%K%P
Then, why did you think it went "evening lit by the moonlight"?

こころ「うん、ちょっとね、前に読んだ物語の中にそう書いてあったから」%K%P
Hn, well, I told you; it was written that way in a book I read a while ago.

ゆに「ふーん……」%K%P
Hmm...

ゆに「でも、あそこのところは『夜明けの晩』であってると思うよ？」%K%P
But, I think "evening lit by the dawn" is how it should be.

ゆには指先のささくれをいじりながら続けた。%K%P
Yuni said so while fiddling with his fingernails.

ゆに「だって、すぐあとの歌詞には『鶴と亀』『後ろの正面』っていうのがあるじゃん？」%K%P
Because, after that, the next lines go "tsuru to kame"――"crane and turtle", "ushiro no shoumen"――"right behind you"――"in front of your back", right?

ゆに「『夜明け』と『晩』」%K%P
"Dawn" and "evening".

ゆに「『鶴』と『亀』」%K%P
"Crane" and "turtle".

ゆに「『後ろ』と『正面』」%K%P
"The back" and "the front".

ゆに「どれもふたつで一対になるものを表わしてる」%K%P
They're all two things that make up a pair by being the opposites of one another.

ゆに「光と影、陰と陽、雄と雌、虚数と実数……」%K%P
Light and shadow, yin and yang, male and female, imaginary numbers and real numbers...

ゆに「この世界は二律背反するふたつの要素がうまく重なりあって共存してるんだ」%K%P
This whole world is made up of elements that contradict each other, but at the same time need to coexist with one another.

ゆに「『かごめ歌』の主題はまさにこれ」%K%P
I think that that is what the "Kagome song" tries to say.

ゆに「だから『月夜の晩』よりも『夜明けの晩』の方がふさわしいんだよ」%K%P
That's why "evening lit by the dawn" would be much more fitting there than "evening lit by the moonlight".

こころ「う～ん、なるほどねぇ～」%K%P
Hmmm～, I see～

私は思わずうなってしまった。%K%P
I groaned without noticing.

ゆに「とは言え、今ぼくの言った解釈が必ずしも正解とは言えない」%K%P
All that being said, my interpretation, may not be completely correct.

ゆに「あの歌にはまだまだいっぱい謎が残されてるからね」%K%P
That song still has many mysteries to it.

こころ「謎？　謎って？」%K%P
Mysteries?  What kind of mysteries?

ゆに「えっと……そうだなぁ……」%K%P
Well... let's see...

ゆに「例えば、そもそも『かごめ』とは何を意味してるのか？」%K%P
For example, what is the meaning behind "kagome"?

ゆに「『籠の中の鳥』が象徴するものとはいったい何なのか？」%K%P
What is the symbolism behind "the bird within the cage"?

ゆに「どうして鶴と亀は滑ってしまったのか？　滑らなければならなかったのか？」%K%P
Why did the crane and the turtle slip? Did they have to slip?

ゆに「それから……」%K%P
And then there's the...

ゆに「うしろのしょーめんだーれ？」%K%P
"Who's that behi――ind you?"

そのフレーズをくちずさむと、ゆには丸いメガネをそっとはずした。%K%P
As he hummed that phrase, Yuni took off his glasses.

左右の手のひらで自らのまぶたを覆いくるりと背中を向ける。%K%P
He covered his eyes with his own hands and turned around.

ゆに「ぼくは今、何も見えない」%K%P
Well! I can't see anything anymore...

ゆに「人間が五感によって外部から入手できる情報のうち、およそ８割は視覚に依存してると言われてるよね？」%K%P
You know? They say that out of all our senses, sight is responsible for eight-tenths of all the information that we humans gather.

ゆに「つまり今のぼくは、身のまわりで起きている様々な現象のうちの２割しか認識できないってこと」%K%P
That means that right now, I'm only able to feel just the two tenths of all that's occurring around me with my other senses.
 
ゆに「残りの８割は、あいまいで、判然としなくて……」%K%P
The remaining 80% is left vague and unclear.

ゆに「お姉ちゃんがぼくの後ろで何をしてるのか、どんな表情をしてるのかもわからない」%K%P
I have no way of knowing what Onee-chan's doing behind me right now, or what kind of an expression she has on.

ゆに「お姉ちゃんの存在は今、ぼくにとっては不確定要素のうちのひとつなんだ」%K%P
Right now, Onee-chan's existence is one of many unknowns to me.

ゆに「後ろの正面は、振り返って目を開くまで……決まらない……」%K%P
Until I open my eyes and turn around, what's behind me is... still undecided...

ゆにが私の顔を見れないのと同じように、私も彼の表情をうかがうことはできなかった。%K%P
Just like how Yuni was unable to see my face, and I was unable to see what kind of expression he had on his.

彼の背中だけをじっと見つめる。%K%P
I was only able to see his back.

とても小さなその背中を……。%K%P
A small back....

こころ「きみ、いくつなの？」%K%P
How old are you, anyway?

しばしの沈黙を経て、私は言った。%K%P
After a slight pause, I asked him that.

ゆに「１１」%K%P
11.

ゆにが目隠しをしたまま振り返る。%K%P
Yuni turned around with his eyes still covered.

中指と薬指の隙間から、ふたつの瞳がのぞいていた。%K%P
Then he peered at me through his fingers.

ゆに「よかった」%K%P
Thank goodness...

ゆに「そこにいてくれて」%K%P
...that you're here!

頬をほころばせてニッコリと笑う。%K%P
His cheeks lift into a broad smile as he laughs.

まだあどけなさの残るその笑顔は確かに１１歳のそれだった。%K%P
His smile was certainly that of an 11-year-old.

耳を澄ますと風の歌が聞こえた。%K%P
The wailing of the wind outside was crystal clear, and was obvious it was raging as strongly as ever.

外はまだ吹雪いているのだろう。%K%P
The snow was still being thrown around outside.

俺は息を殺して鉄扉の前に立った。%K%P
''I'' held my breath as ''I'' stood in front of an iron door.

小さな発光ダイオードが闇の中に赤々とにじんでいる。%K%P
Beside the door, a small red light was blinking in the darkness.

扉の施錠を制御するカードリーダー。%K%P
The card reader that controlled the lock on the door.

赤い光はロックされていることを示していた。%K%P
The treacherous red light gave away its location.

ポケットに手を差し入れて１枚のカードを取り出す。%K%P
''I'' put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a single key card.

%LC%FS『ＳＡＴＯＲＵ　ＹＵＫＩＤＯＨ』%FE%N
SATORU YUKIDOH

%LC%FS『１３３１　２２２３　９８０１』%FE%K%P
1331 2223 8901

凸型に刻まれた文字を指先でなぞる。%K%P
''I'' traced the engraved letters with my fingertip.

悟「優希堂悟……」%K%P
Yukidoh Satoru...

それが俺の名前……。%K%P
That is my name....

俺は自分の名前があまり好きではなかった。%K%P
''I'' haven't ever really liked my name that much.

カードを指にからませてくるりとまわす。%K%P
''I'' twirled the card in my fingers and spun it around.

リーダーの溝にそれを差し込み流れるように滑らせた。%K%P
''I'' inserted it into the reader's slot and let it slide its way through.

ダイオードの色が青へと変わる。%K%P
The light on the card reader turned green.

微かに開いた扉の隙間……。%K%P
The door lock opened and the door crept forward ever so slightly, exposing a small crack....

俺は導かれるように闇の奥へと進んでいった。%K%P
''I'' pushed it open and stepped into the darkness, as if being drawn by something.

ゆに「こころんは、二十歳でしょう？」%K%P
Kokoron is twenty, isn't she?

ふいに、ゆにはそんなことを言った。%K%P
Yuni suddenly said.

あまりにもしつこく付きまとってくるものだから、私は彼に名前（冬川こころ）だけは教えていた。%K%P
As he was asking so persistently, I ended up telling him my name (Fuyukawa Kokoro).

けれど年齢に関しては、その手がかりとなることすら話していない。%K%P
However, I didn't give him anything, not even so much as a clue, that would have allowed him to guess my age.

こころ「ど、どうしてわかったの？」%K%P
H, how would you know?

ゆに「ふふ～ん、すごい？」%K%P
Hehe～, impressed?

こころ「ねえ？　どうして年齢がわかったのか教えてよ？」%K%P
Hey?! Tell me how did you guess how old I am?

私は手短に自己紹介を済ませてから、ゆにを隣の座席に招き入れた。%K%P
I gave a brief self-introduction and Yuni slipped into the seat beside mine.

ゆに「ふふ～ん、すごいでしょう？」%K%P
Fufu～n, impressive, right?

ゆに「こころんは、二十歳でしょう？」%K%P
Kokoron is twenty, isn't she?

それは自己紹介を済ませた直後のことだった。%K%P
That's what he said right after I had introduced myself.

私は彼に名前（冬川こころ）を告げ、これから向かう目的地について軽く話していた。%K%P
I had told him my name (Fuyukawa Kokoro), and then had a little chat with him about the place of our destination.

けれど年齢に関しては、その手がかりとなることすら教えていない。%K%P
However, I hadn't given him any hints or clues that would help him to guess my age like that.

こころ「ど、どうしてわかったの？」%K%P
H, how do you know?

ゆに「ふふ～ん、すごい？」%K%P
Fufu～, impressed?

ゆには座席にふんぞり返ると得意気に鼻を鳴らした。%K%P
Yuni threw his head back onto the seat and made a sound with his nose.

ゆに「超能力かもね？」%K%P
Maybe I'm psychic?

こころ「とぼけてないで教えてよぉ～」%K%P
Come on, stop playing around and tell meee～

ゆに「う～ん……そうだなぁ……」%K%P
Hmm... let's see...

ゆに「教えてあげてもいいけど、その代わり、ひとつだけ頼みたいことがあるんだ」%K%P
I can tell you, but in exchange, I have a favor to ask.

こころ「頼みたいこと？」%K%P
A favor?

ゆに「あのね？　ぼく……ギュンッていうのが苦手なの」%K%P
You see? I'm not really good with... "zoom".

ゆに「ギュンッて、ギュンッて、するときあるでしょ？」%K%P
"Zoom"――there's a part where it goes "zoom", right?

こころ「は？」%K%P
Huh?

ゆに「あーん、わかんないかなぁ？」%K%P
Well, you know, right?

ゆに「着陸のときとかに、急激に高度が下がってギュンッて……重力がなくなるときあるじゃーん」%K%P
When the plane begins to land, it descends rapidly with a "zoom". And there's a point when you feel light... as if gravity disappears.

こころ「ああ、ああ、うん、それで？」%K%P
Ah, well, yes, and?

ゆに「だからね？　この飛行機が着陸態勢に入ったら……」%K%P
So, when this plane starts descending...

うわめづかいに私を見ながら、ゆには続けた。%K%P
Looking at me with upturned eyes, Yuni continued. 

ゆに「手、つないでてもらえないかなぁ？」%K%P
Could I... hold your hand?

私は思わず吹き出しそうになった。%K%P
I burst into laughter without thinking.

けれどゆにの表情は深刻で、冷やかしや揶揄の類は一切受けつけそうもない。%K%P
However, the expression on Yuni's face was so serious that making fun of him just didn't seem right.

ませた言葉づかいをしながらも、彼はやっぱり子どもなのだ、と私は思った。%K%P
Even though his words, at times, showed wisdom beyond his years, inside he was still just a child.

こころ「うん、そのぐらいならいくらでも」%K%P
Well... sure, if that's all it is... be my guest.

ゆに「ほんとに！？」%K%P
Really!?

こころ「とは言え、私の身体に触れることができる男の子なんて滅多にいないんだからねぇ～」%K%P
That being said, there aren't many boys that are allowed to touch me as they please.

こころ「ありがたく思いなさいよ？」%K%P
So be grateful!

ゆにの頭を軽く小突くと、彼は照れくさそうに頬を赤らめながら私の腕に飛びついてきた。%K%P
I lightly poked his head, and he blushed as he grabbed my arm.

やれやれ……『袖すりあうも他生の縁』か……。%K%P
My my... so was him grabbing onto my sleeve a result of karma from a previous life...?

私の他生にはいったい何があったというのだろう。%K%P
Just what exactly had happened in my past life, I wonder?

やれやれ……。%K%P
Oh well....

こころ「で？　正解は？」%K%P
So? What's the answer?

こころ「年齢がわかった理由、教えてくれるんでしょう？」%K%P
You were about to tell me how you knew my age, right?

ゆに「あ、ああ、うん、えっとぉ……」%K%P
A, ah, yes, well...

言いながら、ゆには身体を引き剥がし、片腕を私の後頭部に伸ばした。%K%P
When he said that, Yuni let go of my sleeve and stretched his arm behind my head.

ゆに「これだよ、これ」%K%P
It's this, this.

ゆに「これがこころんの髪の毛についてたから……」%K%P
This was stuck in Kokoron's hair, so...

つかみ取った何かをヒラヒラと揺らして見せる。%K%P
In his hand was a fluttering object, which he presented to me.

ゆにの指先がつまんでいたもの――。%K%P
The object Yuni was holding between his fingers was――

それは綿毛のようにふわふわとした小さな白い羽だった。%K%P
A small white feather, as light and soft as down.

%TS104Ｒ%TEの小さな螺旋階段が上へ上へと続いている。%K%P
%TS104Ｒ%TE section's small spiraling stairs continued to go up higher and higher.

まるで巨大なウワバミの背鱗を歩いているようだった。%K%P
It felt as if ''I'' was walking up the scales of a giant constrictor snake.

ウワバミは中心にそびえ立った太い円柱をギリギリと絞め殺していた。%K%P
A constrictor snake which had wrapped itself around a huge column as it desperately tried to strangle it.

足を進めるたびに鉄の鱗が冷たい音を奏でた。%K%P
Its iron scales made sharp, cold sounds as my feet continued on their journey.

%N
%LCダビデは琴を弾いていた……%K%P
And David played with his hand, as at other times...
%N
%LCサウルの手には槍があった……%K%P
And there was a javelin in Saul's hand...
%N
%LCサウルは槍を投げつけて……%K%P
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said...
%N
%LCわたしはダビデを壁にでも……%K%P
I will smite David even to the wall with it...
//changed all this to the direct Bible verse as quoted on the top page. - the_paper
//old: David was playing the harp... / And there was a javelin in Saul's hands... / And Saul cast the javelin.../ I shall pin David to the wall...

くちからもれたその声は、自分のものとは思えなかった。%K%P
''I'' didn't think of the words coming out of my mouth as my own.

誰かが俺の耳元で、ささやいているような気さえした。%K%P
It was as if some spirit was whispering them into my ear.

%N
%LC俺はダビデを突き刺してやる……%K%P
''I'' will smite David...

%N
%LCたとえ再びかわされようと……%K%P
Even if he avoided it twice...
//Never read the bible, but these are slightly paraphrased words from the old testament. They are right there in the main page. 
//changed this one too. - the_paper
//This didn't need to be changed. It's not a quote, but (uhm...spoilers?) refers to the will of 俺. Dunno how to be more indirect...  

出口が近づいていた。ウワバミに頭はなかった。%K%P
The entrance ''I'' was looking for was near. Thankfully, this constrictor ''I'' was making my way up on didn't have a head.

相手を絞め殺す前に、その首を斬り落とされてしまったのだろうか。%K%P
Perhaps, before it could finally strangle its prey, its head was cut off...

時計台の歯車が不気味な音をたてていた。%K%P
The cogwheels of the clock tower made an eerie noise.

カタカタと……カタカタと……。%K%P
Rattle... rattle....

悠久の時を操る呪文のように聞こえた。%K%P
It sounded as if a spell was being cast: a charm to control eternity's time.

こころ「羽？」%K%P
A feather?

ゆに「そう、羽」%K%P
Yup, a feather.

こころ「これが、私の髪の毛に？」%K%P
This was in my hair?

ゆに「うん、後ろのところにね」%K%P
Yes, it was on the back of your head.

この羽がどうして付いていたのか、私には心当たりがなかった。%K%P
I had no idea why a feather would be there.

ゆに「こころん、昨日お風呂入らなかったでしょう？」%K%P
Kokoron, you didn't take a bath yesterday, did you?

こころ「失礼ねぇ、ちゃんと入ったわよ」%K%P
Hey, that's quite rude of you, you know? And for your information, I'm pretty sure I DID take a bath yesterday.

ゆに「嘘だ」%K%P
That's a lie.

こころ「どうしてそんなことで嘘つかなきゃならないの？」%K%P
And why would I lie about something like that?

ゆに「だってこころんのまぶた、ちょっと腫れてるから」%K%P
Because Kokoron's eyelids are a little swollen.

ゆに「寝不足なんじゃないの？」%K%P
It's from a lack of sleep, isn't it?

そう言って、ゆにはポケットから鏡を取り出すと、鏡面を私の方に向けた。%K%P
Saying that, Yuni took out a mirror from his pocket and placed it right in front of my face.

ゆに「ね？」%K%P
Right?

ゆにが指摘した通り、私のまぶたは少しだけ赤みを帯びていた。%K%P
Just as Yuni had said, my eyelids showed a slight tinge of red.

寝不足であることは事実だったのだ。%K%P
It was true that I didn't get much sleep.

ゆうべはこの旅の準備で忙しかったし、それに……。%K%P
Last night I was in a rush to prepare for this trip, and....

『彼女』に会う前にできるだけ多くの情報を頭にたたき込んでおく必要もあった。%K%P
Before I could meet "her", I wanted to fill my head with as much information as possible.

ベッドに入ったのは、空が明るくなってからだった。%K%P
When I finally got to bed, the sky was already growing light.

こころ「確かに、あんまり寝てないのは事実よ？」%K%P
Well, it's a fact that I didn't get much sleep...

こころ「だけど、それとこれとどういう関係があるの？」%K%P
But what do this and that have to do with one another?
//old: But what could those two things possibly have to do with each other? <<there are more than 2 things in context here, and no 2 things have ever been juxtaposed in their previous conversation anyway - so the more general expression should be used -vtiger

こころ「羽と年齢の話はいったいどうなっちゃったわけ？」%K%P
How is my lack of sleep related to the feather? Or to my age, for that matter?

ゆに「まあまあまあ、あせらないあせらない」%K%P
Now, now, now, don't rush me...

ゆに「ちゃんと順を追って説明していくからね？」%K%P
I'll explain everything in order, okay?

ゆにはふたつ折りの鏡をパタリと閉め、ポケットにしまった。%K%P
Yuni snapped the folding mirror shut and slipped it back into his pocket.

ゆに「まず、日付の確認からしておこう」%K%P
First off, let's confirm the date.

ゆに「今日は西暦何年の何月何日何曜日だっけ？」%K%P
Today's date is what day of what month in what year?

こころ「２０１１年１月１１日火曜日」%K%P
The date is January 11, 2011. Tuesday.

ゆに「ＯＫ～」%K%P
OK～

ゆに「じゃあ、昨日は何の日だった？」%K%P
Then, what day was it yesterday?

こころ「１月１０日月曜日……成人の日？」%K%P
January 10th, Monday... Coming of Age Day?

ゆに「うむ」%K%P
Yup.

ゆに「さてと、そこでこの羽の登場だ」%K%P
Now then, that's where this feather comes in.

先程の羽を手のひらで踊らせながら、ゆには言葉をつないだ。%K%P
Yuni said, as the feather danced on the palm of his hand.

ゆに「女の子が振り袖を着るとき肩にかけるショール」%K%P
When girls put on their long kimono, they wear shawls over their shoulders.

ゆに「その素材の中でも最もポピュラーなのがフェザー、ホワイトグースの羽なんだ」%K%P
Of all of the materials used to make shawls, the most popular is the feather of the white goose.

ゆに「そして恐らくは、ぼくの手のひらに乗っているこの羽も……」%K%P
And so, the feather I'm holding in my hand right now is most likely...

ゆに「あとは、言わなくてもわかるよね？」%K%P
I don't need to say any more for you to put the remaining pieces of the puzzle into place, do I?

こころ「つまり私は、昨日振り袖を着て成人式に出席したってこと？」%K%P
In other words, I wore a shawl over my kimono when I was attending my coming of age ceremony yesterday?

こころ「そのとき肩にかけてたショールの羽が取れて私の髪についた」%K%P
And it was then that the feather came off the shawl and got attached to my hair?

ゆに「成人式と言えば、小学校や中学校で机を並べた旧友達が一同に会すビッグイベントでしょ？」%K%P
The Coming of Age Ceremony is like a big event where you invite all your friends from elementary school and middle school to meet up, right?

ゆに「初恋の男の子が見違えるほどブサイクになってたり……」%K%P
Where you find out that you misjudged your first crush, and he ended up becoming homely or plain...
//nnn... its better not to use gender here imo, since its a male talking about human experience in general, and when you talk to a girl about love or smth similar you'd tend to generalize rather than speak from someones point of view. "a first crush" encompasses completely the meaning of "the guy you had your first crush on" and is grammatically sound - if thats what you were worried about

ゆに「あんまりパッとしなかった女の子が妬ましいぐらいにキレイになってたりして……」%K%P
And that the plain girl in class had become enviably pretty...

ゆに「ともかく、そんな邂逅が次から次へと訪れることによって、出席者の誰もが心を弾ませ身を躍らせることになる」%K%P
Anyway, one chance encounter is followed by the next; you learn many surprising things, everyone's emotions get stirred up, and energy fills the air!
//old: Anyway, everybody continues to find out more and more surprising things that stir up their emotions. Energy fills the air.
//"and eventually, usually at least, everyone begins to dance." cut from the end since it is of no relevance and makes the line very choppy

ゆに「同様に、当時のこころんも激しい昂揚感に包まれていたであろうことは想像に難くない」%K%P
It's not hard to imagine being engulfed by intense uplifting emotions...

ゆに「そんな浮ついた恍惚状態のさなか……」%K%P
Being swept up in such a buoyant mood...

ゆに「式を終えたこころんは、かつてつるんでいた仲良しグループに誘われるがまま２次会へと赴いた」%K%P
So as the ceremony was coming to an end, you went to an after-party with another group of close friends.

ゆに「誰はばかることなく堂々とアルコールが飲める年齢ということもあったのだろう」%K%P
You'd also finally reached the age where you could drink alcohol without interference, right?
//The legal drinking age in Japan is 20.
//old: You're probably at an age where you go out drinking with reckless abandon.
//You're at an age where you go around drinking, and don't shun from anyone, aren't you?

ゆに「２次会はやがて３次会となり、３次会は４次会へ、４次会は５次会へ……気がつけば東の空が明るくなっていた」%K%P
When the first after-party's over, it's on to the second, and then the third, and then the fourth... and before you know it, the sun is rising in the eastern sky.
//A nijikai (２次会) is the second event/after party following the main event/enkai (宴会); the next one is the sanjikai, and so on. - the_paper 
//now this sentence finally makes some sense to me; we just need to take them down a notch, since the first after-party would be considered the 1st event here -vtiger

ゆに「結果、ろくに眠ることもできず、まぶたは赤く腫れあがり、シャワーを浴びる余裕もなく……」%K%P
The result: no sleep, red eyelids, and no time to even take a shower...

ゆに「こころんは襟足に羽を付けたまま、慌ててこの飛行機に飛び乗ったってわけ」%K%P
Kokoron, with the feather still stuck in her hair, was rushing to get on this plane at the last moment.

ゆに「どう？　当たりでしょう？」%K%P
So, whaddaya think? I got all of it right, didn't I?

矢継ぎ早に告げられたそれらの言葉に、私は思わず閉口した。%K%P
Hearing all those statements in such quick succession left me feeling embarrassed long before I fully noticed it myself.

ゆにの瞳はらんらんと輝き、頬はほのかに上気している。%K%P
Yuni's eyes were sparkling and his cheeks were flushed with red.

こころ「はぁ……１枚の羽からよくそんな妄想が思いつくわね？」%K%P
Hah... it's amazing how you far you took this wild delusion based off of a single feather.

ゆに「妄想？　これは妄想なんかじゃないよ」%K%P
Delusion? This isn't a delusion at all.

ゆに「極めて論理的な推理さ」%K%P
It's an extremely logical deduction.

こころ「なるほどぉ、自信満々だぁー」%K%P
I see... so you're quite confident, aren't you.

ゆに「まあね」%K%P
I guess～

こころ「だけど、その『極めて論理的な推理』ってやつは……」%K%P
However, that "extremely logical deduction" is actually...

こころ「残念ながら――大ハズレェーッ！――だよ？」%K%P
Unfortunately... completely wrong～!

ゆに「……えっ？」%K%P
...Huh?

こころ「だって私ぃ～、２月生まれだもん」%K%P
Because～, I was born in February.

こころ「成人式は、去年やっちゃったんだ♪」%K%P
I had my coming of age ceremony last year♪

私がそう告げたとたん、ゆにの目は点になった。%K%P
As soon as I said those words, Yuni's eyes opened wide, leaving two little dots where his cheerful, saucer-like pupils would usually be.

くちを半開きにし、愕然としているようだ。%K%P
His mouth was left half-open in shock.

ゆに「うそーっ！　じゃあこの羽は！？　この羽は！？」%K%P
That's a lie! Then what about this feather? What about the feather?!

ゆに「この羽は、なんでこころんの髪に付いてたの！？」%K%P
Why was this feather stuck in your hair!?

こころ「さあねぇ～」%K%P
Who knows～

ゆに「『さあね』って……」%K%P
"Who knows～", you say...

こころ「あっ、でもここは雲の上だし……」%K%P
Ah... well, after all, we are high above the clouds here...

こころ「もしかしたら、天使の羽かもね？」%K%P
It might just be an angel's feather, you know?

ゆに「天使……の？」%K%P
An... angel?

不思議そうに呟いて、ゆには窓の外に目を向けた。%K%P
Murmuring that in wonder, Yuni turned to look out the window.
// old: After muttering "how mysterious", Yuni turned around and faced the window.

うろたえたゆにの姿は、電子犬を前にした仔犬みたいで可愛かった。%K%P
His flustered appearance resembled that of a puppy placed in front of a robot dog, and was all the cuter for it.
// old: Yuni's figure, previously that of a cute and lively puppy, now resembled, for a lack of a better analogy, that of a robot dog.

私はくすくすと笑ってしまった。%K%P
I couldn't help but giggle quietly to myself.

その笑い声が耳に届いたのか、ゆにはぷるぷると首を振り……。%K%P
My laughs reached Yuni's ears, and his neck tensed up....

ゆに「天使なんて、いるわけないじゃん！」%K%P
There's no way angels could exist!

こころ「そうかなぁ～？」%K%P
Is that so～?

ゆに「そうだよ！」%K%P
It is!

こころ「まっ、いずれにせよ、ガチョウの羽だって解釈するよりはロマンティックでしょ？」%K%P
Well, either way, it's much more romantic than the goose feather explanation, right?

ゆに「こころんは、ロマンティックかどうかで事実を判断するの？」%K%P
So to decide whether something is true or not, you just check with yourself to see if it's romantic or not, and if you like what you end up with, then you believe in it?

こころ「ときにはね？」%K%P
Once in a while, I guess...

ゆに「論理的な根拠なんてどうでもいいんだ？」%K%P
So having a logical basis for something doesn't even matter?

こころ「だからぁ『ときには』って言ったじゃない」%K%P
Come on, I did say "once in a while", didn't I?

こころ「論理的に証明できることだったらそれを信じるし、証明できないことだったら私は……」%K%P
If there's a logical explanation for something, then I'll believe it, but if there isn't one, I...

ゆに「ロマンティックな方を選ぶ？」%K%P
"Will choose the most romantic option?"

こころ「そういうこと」%K%P
Pretty much.

ゆには虚ろな瞳で手のひらの羽をぼんやりと眺めていた。%K%P
With a blank look on his face, Yuni gazed absentmindedly at the feather in his palm.

心ここにあらずといった感じで、かたまったように動かない。%K%P
He was utterly still, as if his soul had gone somewhere else and left his body frozen in place.
//old: It seemed almost like his heart stopped beating for a short while, and he stayed motionless as if frozen solid. 

ゆに「ねえ、こころん？　この羽、もらってもいい？」%K%P
Hey, Kokoron? Is it all right if I keep this feather?

視線をうつむけたまま、唇だけを動かす。%K%P
His eyes were downcast, only his lips moving.

こころ「いいけど、そんなものもらってどうするの？」%K%P
Sure, but what are you going to do with it?

ゆに「記念にするんだ」%K%P
It'll be a memento.

こころ「記念？」%K%P
Memento?

私が問い返すと、ゆにはパッと顔をあげて言った。%K%P
When I asked that, Yuni raised his head.

ゆに「そう、記念だよ」%K%P
Yes, a memento.

ゆに「こころんと出逢ったことを、忘れないようにするための……」%K%P
So that I don't ever forget that I met Kokoron...

こんなセリフをさりげなく言えてしまうのは年齢のせいだろうか。%K%P
It surprised me how he said those words so casually... it must have been his age.

私と同世代の男の子にはない（あるいは彼らが失ってしまった）原石のような純粋さを、ゆには持っているような気がした。%K%P
The brutal straightforward frankness the boys my age just don't possess (or rather have lost somewhere in their past). Yuni, however, still hasn't lost that gift...

ゆにがあと７歳年を取っていたとしたら、私はどぎまぎしながら大慌てで席を立っていたことだろう。%K%P
If Yuni were seven years older, that short exchange of words would have left me so embarrassed and flustered I'd have had to stand up from my seat to cool off.

なぜならその方が、ロマンティックだから……。%K%P
Because those simple words would have been so incredibly romantic....

しかしこのとき私が取った行動はと言うと……。%K%P
But right now, I simply chose to say....

こころ「もう～っ、かわいいなぁー、こいつこいつぅ～♪」%K%P
Aww～ How cuuute♪～

ゆにをいきなり抱きしめて、そのサラサラヘアーをくしゃくしゃに撫でまわすというものだった。%K%P
Without warning, I hugged Yuni and messed up his smooth hair with my hands.

ゆに「うー、うー、ぐるぢいよぉ……！」%K%P
Uu, uu, I can't breathe...!

ゆに「死ぬ、死ぬってば……まじでまじで……！」%K%P
I'm dying, I'm dying... Seriously! I'm seriously dying here...!

ゆに「っていうか、メガネ折れっから！　メガネ折れっから！」%K%P
And more importantly, my glasses! You'll break my glasses!

ゆに「折れっから！　割れっから！」%K%P
They'll break! I'm telling you, they'll break!

ゆに「助けてぇー！　誰かぁー！　スッチィー！」%K%P
Save meee! Anyoneee! Stewardeeess!

ゆには私の胸の中で小動物みたいにもがいていた。%K%P
Yuni struggled like a cute small animal in my arms.

The successful creation of Dolly shed new light on the potentials of genetic engineering.",

She was cloned from the mammary tissue (somatic cells) of an adult sheep, making her the first \"somatic cell clone using nuclear transfer\" (hereinafter simply \"clone\") in the world.%NIn other words, the success of the technology to create a \"somatic cell clone using nuclear transfer\" served to verify the hypothesis that \"if somatic cells were available, it would be possible to bring any animal back to life as an exact copy, any number of times.\"",

            "However, the combined power of forces such as sheer human curiosity, infertility problems, and possibly \"the wish to meet again with lost loved ones\" would not let it be stopped altogether. Thus, illegal research continued behind the scenes, and before long, the birth cries of the very first human clones were heard in the world.%NAs a result, various protests and controversies took root, and in many countries, the ethical issue was back on the table for the furious debate about to unfold.",

I'm so grateful to Papa. Because Papa is the one who gave me this life...\"",

Since the genome mother and host mother are two different people, the clone cannot be said to be an exact replica of the original.)",

            "In science fiction literature and the like, authors sometimes include settings called \"parallel worlds.\"  A common setup is for the protagonist to see worlds that are very similar to the one we live in, but are different in subtle ways. Every time the protagonist makes a choice in life, several worlds diverge from that point based on the number of alternatives.",
            "It turns out that a similar way of thinking also exists in physics.%NThis is the so-called \"many-worlds interpretation,\" proposed by a scholar named Hugh Everett. It elaborates on the quantum mechanical way of thinking, and is competitive with the current mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics.",
            "In quantum mechanics, both matter and energy are seen as a certain kind of \"wave.\"%NTo avoid confusion, the word \"wave\" here refers strictly to waves in the world of quantum mechanics, rather than the concept of waves in classical theory which are transmitted and spread outward in all directions.%NQuantum mechanical waves are basically \"waves of probability.\"",
            "When dealing with the world on a microscopic scale, there is a restriction that prevents an object's position and momentum from both being known simultaneously (the uncertainty principle), meaning that you can only say the object exists in a particular place with some probability. Because of this, quantum mechanics considers the existence of the object from a probabilistic perspective. The mathematical tool used to describe this phenomenon is called a \"wave function.\"",
            "Before looking at the many-worlds interpretation, we'll try thinking about how standard quantum mechanics currently explains the world.%NFor example, consider a single electron. Before you perform the act of observing that it exists in a particular location, its existence is spread out in a probabilistic way due to uncertainty.%N%NUntil you actually look at it,%Nits existence is described by assigning a probability to all of the places where it could possibly exist.",
            "In this state, we call it an \"electron cloud.\"%N%NNow, suppose you were to use some method to observe the electron.%NAt that moment, assuming that the electron's position was determined, the previously spread-out cloud would immediately gather at that single observed point (likewise for momentum).%NThis is called a \"wave function collapse\"; it basically means that the act of observing the electron, which was previously viewed as a probability distribution,",
            "renders its fixed existence as a real phenomenon.%NThis explanation is known as the \"Copenhagen interpretation,\" and is considered mainstream in modern quantum mechanics.",
            "Now then, what about the rivaling many-worlds interpretation?%NIt agrees with the Copenhagen interpretation on the treatment of the electron's existence as a probability distribution.%NThe question is, what happens after the moment the electron is observed? Under the many-worlds interpretation, the probability distribution is considered to be maintained regardless of whether the electron is observed or not.  But what does that mean?",
            "For example,%Nwhen an observer confirms that the electron is in a particular position, the other possibilities don't just disappear. Instead, they actually persist in other worlds the observer can't perceive. It's not such a ridiculous idea. Isn't it because we can't perceive them in our world that we say \"they don't exist\"?%NCertainly, if an observer observes that a possibility doesn't exist, then it doesn't exist in his world. However, \"it does exist\" in the worlds of observers other than that one.",
            "In other words, under the many-worlds interpretation, even the observers are explained probabilistically (the wave function does not only consist of the target of observation, but also the observer's entire space-time).%NThat means that every possibility, which has a non-zero probability, exists at the same time.%NEvery possible world advances simultaneously, which can be interpreted as truly \"many worlds.\"",
            "If you think about it, the main point is this:%Nobservers and observed things are made from the same substance to begin with. There's no reason whatsoever for an interpretation to distinguish between the two.%N%NSomeone who dislikes the idea of a person receiving special treatment might find the many-worlds interpretation easy to warm up to.%NIt gives the impression that it was originally created for the purpose of explaining why waves should suddenly collapse at the moment of observation.",
